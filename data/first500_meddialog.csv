"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well."
"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing? I do not get excited during sex and unable to ejaculate. Only, rubbing the tip of the penis gives me excitement. Also, two weeks ago, I have undergone circumcision as my foreskin did not retract. Before circumcision too, I have the same problem. Please help."
"Hi doctor, I am a 22-year-old female who often suffers constipation to the point where I feel like I get minor external hemorrhoids that often bleed. Again, I have not got doctor verification for this but that is what I think. Recently, I have been experiencing pain around the left side of my stomach. I cannot localize it. Sometimes I feel like it is on my back, sometimes the lateral side, and sometimes the front. It usually happens after I eat or pass a stool but I have a minor sensation of discomfort even when I am just sitting. All of this has been getting a lot worse the past couple of days. I often feel nauseated too. I think I may have diverticulitis, however, I am not sure how common it is for my age. I also feel like I have a small localized swelling on the LUQ that hurts when I press on it. I am not sure what is wrong and I really want to go get some tests done but I do not feel safe going to a hospital with certain circumstances."
"Hi doctor, I am 27 years old. My weight is 48 kg, and height is 5.8 feet. I am a pure vegetarian. I need to increase my body weight. I am suffering from psychological problems like anxiety.

"Hello doctor, I am a 39-year-old woman. I have mild pain in the left side of the chest (below the neck and above the breast) and then sensation in the upper back from four days. It comes and goes. Sometimes it goes to the right side of the chest also. I have done my ECG and blood test 6 months ago. ECG and blood sugar were normal. No hypertension but hemoglobin was 10 and Vitamin B 12 was below average. What can I do as in lockdown it is not possible to see the doctor as a person. Please help."
"Hello doctor, I am a 39-year-old male. I am 168 cm in height and 68 kg in weight. Since last one month, I have been suffering from intermittent loose motions (yellow colored). There is no vomiting, no fever, or major abdominal pain (except for occasional cramps). Initially, I took a combination of Norfloxacin and Tinidazole for four days, but things did not improve. Thereafter on the prescription of my doctor I took Metronidazole 400 and Dicyclomine 20 mg for a period of 14 days. I also took Lactobacillus tablets for the entire period. During these times I only ate poha, rice, curd, and banana. Also, I took boiled water. It is the fifth day now and I have discontinued the medicines. Despite on such a bland diet (no wheat), I still have at least one to two loose motions in a day. My routine medical tests were done in January this year which was normal. My wife and son also developed loose motion in between for a very brief period. However, they recovered fully within three days. Please advice."
"Hi doctor, I am a 22-year-old female who was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (genetic) when I was 12. Over the past five years, I have become around 50 pounds overweight and all of my attempts to lose have seemed to fail so I have given up, but my weight has stayed the same. There is so much information put there about losing weight with hypothyroidism but it all seems to conflict. I am so unsure as to what type of exercise and diet I should follow as a result but I still would like to lose weight, but most importantly have my body feel better. What can I do? I am currently on Levothyroxine, Buspar, and Benedryl."
"Hi doctor, I am a 13-year-old male and I have had semen leakage for about three months. I think it is from weak nerves because last year, I would masturbate a lot but then I stopped because it was becoming painful and I was embarrassed. Then about three months ago, I watched something inappropriate and I ejaculated without doing anything. Then a week later, I started to have semen leakage every day about three to four times a day. I am just very worried and I just want this to be cured and go away. Also, could this affect my eyes in any way? Please help."
"Hello doctor, I was diagnosed with PCOS in January so my gynecologist prescribed me Ginette 35 for six months and Bonemac D3 for one month.

"Hi doctor, I am 16 years old. I just recently discovered that I have scoliosis. I do not know much about it but I will tell you what I know. My scoliosis currently has only a 3-degree curve and I am pretty confident it is a C shaped curve, although I am not sure. What do you think are the chances that my scoliosis will develop into adulthood? Do you think it will stop progressing once I am fully grown?"
"Hello doctor, I have a 2.5-month-old who I recently noticed developed a tongue tremor. I looked up online for the causes and found them as SMA. She has great motor control, we were not doing tummy time as often because she did not like it but have increased it and have seen a big improvement. My doctor believes it is benign tongue tremor, unfortunately, we had a telehealth appointment due to COVID so he was unable to see her but he told me not to worry and to keep an eye if things get worse. I am so scared it is SMA, what else should I be looking for?"

"Hello doctor,  I am a 60-year-old male who just received the results of a 24-hour Holter monitor. Key findings include: Sinus rhythm with frequent supraventricular ectopy (2559) which included couplets and one seven beat SVE multiplet. No complex forms. No significant pauses or periods of heart block noted. Constant feeling of missed beats coincides with frequent supraventricular ectopy. Very infrequent ventricular ectopy that was isolated and univocal. Cardiologists not concerned with findings and recommended positive affirmation, distraction, and cognitive behavioral strategies. He was very reluctant to recommend anti-arrhythmic treatment seeing this as overkill. Other matters of interest. Recent stress echo (March) indicated above average fitness for age (14 mets) and reached a maximum heart rate of 160 bpm. Moderate aortic regurgitation (grade 3-4), normal ejection fraction (60), LVEDV (138 mls), no demonstrable ischemia or arrhythmia. The recent PACs are very noticeable and I feel every one of them. I would appreciate a second opinion or advice on whether there is anything else I can do to stop them. I am currently on Atenolol 100 mg, Crestor 40 mg, Effexor 74 mg, and Valium 5 mg."

She is unable to move her left arm for the past three days and also has shoulder pain, especially when not sitting. There was no injury to the arm.

"Hi doctor, My last period was on April 28. It has been almost seven weeks and I still have not had my period yet. I had unprotected sex on May 24 thinking my ovulation day is over but I started getting very paranoid last week. So I took a pregnancy test on June 10th and it was negative. Then I took one more yesterday on June 14th and it was negative, but if I squinted hard enough it could have been positive. I am very paranoid right now because I do not have a supportive family and I do not have health insurance to go to the doctor to get this checked out, and I am not ready to have a child. I am 21 years old living with my very conservative religious immigrant parents and I do not know if I should take the second pregnancy test seriously. I have been stressed out for the past one month which makes me think I am skipping a month but I am still very afraid that there is a chance I may be pregnant. I have no symptoms of pregnancy. Is it likely that I am pregnant?"

"Hi, This is regarding my husband who is 35 years of age. Four years back, after a nasal septoplasty surgery, the doctors realized that his blood pressure was very high. After doing all the tests he was diagnosed with moderate concentric LVH. My husband who is 5 feet and 6 inches was 98 kgs then. He was put on hypertension medicines and was on diet and exercise and he visits his cardiologist every 3 months. He has now reduced his weight to 79 kgs. In the ECG report taken last year, the diagnosis is Sinus Arrhythmia, Prolonged P-wave and complete Right Bundle Branch Block. The Echo report at the same time says concentric LVH, No RWM. Normal Valves, Normal LV systolic function (62%). Doctor had advised him to continue with his medicines, diet and exercise. What do you make of the ECG and Echo test? Is it fine to continue with the hypertension medicines, diet and exercise. His blood pressure is under control now. Could the LVH be reversed?"

"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

"Hello doctor, I am a 32-year-old male. I weigh about 80 kg with a height of 5'9"". I am facing erection issues since last week though there is no change in my sex drive. Also, I feel reduced morning erections too. I feel aroused but the erection does not come as it used to before a week. Healthwise, I have sound health and have a moderately active lifestyle and pretty normal sleep pattern. Anxiety level is suboptimal due to COVID19 situation. I was using a semen volumizer herbal supplement intermittently. I am not sure if this plays any role in it too. I drink occasionally in limits and I am a vegetarian. My food habits are healthy and I avoid junk food as such. These erection problems started just a few days ago and now they are troubling me to a bigger extent. Please help."
"Hello doctor, My 59-year-old husband has had a fever for about 10 days, the first two days it varied between 37.8 and 38.8 maximum and small diarrhea without any other symptoms. We thought it was the COVID at the beginning but it cannot be because he had no other symptoms and me and my children have been in contact with him and we have no symptoms (knowing that I have health problems and have asthma) so we went to a doctor who prescribed diarrhea medication. Since the fever has dropped and it does not exceed 37.7 (so he continues to take Paracetamol) but for the past week he has been suffering from abdominal pain more precisely below the navel. So we went back to see the same doctor two days ago, who gave him an ultrasound that showed nothing abnormal. He diagnosed a colopathy but I have the impression that this diagnosis is wrong. He started this treatment that same day but until today there is no improvement. He still suffers from abdominal pain especially after going to the bathroom and fever although low (maximum 37.7 °) got as high as 38.8 tonight, no more diarrhea but little constipation. What do you recommend that I do? Could it be something serious knowing that the ultrasound showed nothing abnormal? Please help."
"Hello doctor, My brother has swelling on his left foot. He has a boil on his left inner leg 4 inches above his left ankle inner bone. The doctor he visited gave him medicines for his boil and said the boil will come out in some days. The swelling in his foot has increased and so he visited the same doctor the next day and was advised to see an orthopedic. The orthopedic doctor did not diagnose it but referred him to a general doctor who again did not diagnose it but said there is pus buildup inside the foot and it needs surgery. My father who accompanied my brother asked the doctor whether it will subside with medicines or if surgery is needed. The doctor simply said you can use the medicine or you can do the surgery. I am out of the country and feel the doctor may have not specified the situation correctly to my father and also may have not clearly explained why he suggested the surgery. I needed a second opinion, as I want my brother to receive proper treatment and identify if it is a serious condition and I need to know the best solution. I also want to know why the doctor mentioned surgery for a pus buildup and what is the diagnosis of the foot condition. I can provide pictures of my brother's foot if needed."

I am looking for a doctor to weigh in on this issue."

"Hi doctor! I used to have clear skin but since I moved to a new place, I started to have lots of acne on my face particularly on my forehead. I thought it would disappear once I went back home, but it only got worse. I did some research and assumed that it was caused by drinking too much cow's milk, but it has been since since I stopped and they would still not go away. I also noticed that I get deep acne whenever I'm nearing my period, along with the usual small red bumps. I bought an acne soap and have been using it for a month now but I'm not sure if it works. I hope you can help me because it has been affecting my mental state lately :(((("
"Hello doctor, I am not able to conceive after trying for almost one year. I was diagnosed with pituitary microadenoma and I am on medication. My prolactin levels have now reached normal levels after two months taking medication. I suffer from hypothyroidism and on medication. I have had this for five years now and it is well within the limits as per my endocrinologist now. This is due to an autoimmune disease where my TPO (thyroid peroxidase) antibodies were high during the diagnosis five years ago. My husband and I would like to know how should we best prepare for pregnancy and what to look out for. We would have preferred to visit the clinic. Unfortunately, I am not in a position to visit the doctor due to travel restrictions. It would be great to get in touch with a specialist. I am currently on Euthrox 100 mcg, Cabergoline 0.25 mg once a week, and Folic acid 450 mg daily."

"Hello doctor, I am a 33-year-old male. I have not had any previous health problems, non-smoker, and non-drinker. Generally, I am feeling fine. For the past six months, I have produced bloody semen with blood clots and producing more recently. I have also recently started feeling mild pain behind my right testicle. Occasionally, my left testicles seem to change in size slightly and seem to almost disappear and the right testicle becomes quite tender and firm. I had an ultrasound scan about six years ago and there was found some cyst but little concern. About a week ago, I sensed a small lump rising above my right testicle to my lower abdomen, it was uncomfortable but I slept and the discomfort eventually went away. I see little blood-colored spots appearing on my arms and torso perhaps resembling perhaps petechiae and have an area of this rash on my torso that I am not sure may be related to my concern? I have been taking Azithromycin since yesterday incase it may be a virus or something bacterial but it does not seem to be helping the problem. I had a blood test in January 2020, but have not been able to make a follow-up blood test yet. Not sure why it might be necessary. What does the problem sound like to you?"

"Hello doctor, I am a 26-year-old female. I have joint pain in widespread bilaterally in elbows, knees, and ankles. I also have muscle tenderness on my neck and shoulders and back pain from a herniated disc. I take Diclofenac 75 mg PRN for pain. I have had laboratory work done and I have seen a rheumatologist. My initial labs: ANA positive 1:160 speckled. CRP was elevated. My anti-DS DNA, CCP and RA factor were all negative. Secondary lab work through ELISA showed negative ANA and all other autoimmune laboratories were negative except for positive anti-phosphatidylserine/Prothrombim A at 44 units. Slightly low vitamin D but I take supplements. I eat a plant based diet and exercise twice a week. My other medical history includes depression and anxiety for which I take medication. My question is despite my labs being negative, why do I still have joint pain and muscles aches?"
"Hi doctor,  I am 21 years old and having regular single heart palpations. I have an Apple Watch which provides an ECG and this shows my heart is beating at regular intervals, but there is fairly regularly a single beat which is much larger. I can feel this in my stomach/chest area and feels like a heavy beat or a missed beat. I will upload a couple of PDF results to show you. You can quite clearly see when these large beats take place. I sometimes get chest pain but I usually attribute this to my stomach or anxiety, and the chest pain does not tend to accompany the heart palpitation. My main worry is it is quite regularly happening and it is one singular beat which is ‘off’.

And I am just nervous because it is probably obvious that I do not brush- the bristles are always a really weird texture for me and I just do not want anyone to be mad at me because I have known about it for a while now (I feel bad for saying this, but I think it has been around six months) and never mentioned it to anyone because I am little scared of going to the dentist. I do not like anyone feeling around in my mouth and knowing about this cavity is making me even more nervous for going there today. I have had teeth pulled in the past and I hate everything about it, but I am not sure they could just fill in this cavity."

"Hello doctor,  Age of the child: 20 Months  Gender: Male  Weight: 12 Kilograms  Height: 30 inches  Started Walking: 15 Months  Started Sitting: 5 months  Started Crawling: 12 months  Problem:  My baby has started walking at the age of 15 months and is very active. He runs, jumps, rolls, and can climb stairs with the help of an adult. And can speak 2 words sentences. The problem we are facing is a balance issue. He is an active child but has an issue in maintaining good posture and is easy to fall. When standing straight and static an observer can feel that he is dizzy and swings slightly left and right to maintain the balance. He also has lazy neck control. At 2 months of age he suffered from “Torticollis” which we have managed to minimize by exercises recommended by other pediatrics. He also has digestion problems since birth and has loose motion after 1 week. He has also slight drooling. My question: Is this balance probelm common in this age group or should we choose to consult an in-person doctor which I am avoiding due to COVID-19 crisis as the hospitals are crowded."

"Hello doctor, I have three medical concerns that I think might be related. One is that I have soreness in my left armpit, another is that my left ankle has been swollen lately, and finally I have a one in circle ark that looks like a faded bruise in my left groin. There is no swelling associated with this and no pain. The last one has been persistent for a few months (and the circle got darker when I went on Bactrim for a UTI but then got lighter again). Could these three things be related? Is there any cause for concern?"

"Hello doctor, I found a very small dark spot on my thigh today. To the best of my recollection, I have never seen it before. Now, of course, I am thinking the worse and believe I have melanoma. I am olive-skinned. I have never had an issue with moles or dark spots before. My mom had a pre-cancerous growth removed from her face years ago and she is fine. She goes to her check-ups and applies sunscreen all the time. When I was a kid, I never saw my mom applying sunscreen. It was the 70's and it was just something we did not do. She just turned 76. I attached a photo. I am sure you will think it is something that should be looked at and so do I. I am going to make an appointment with a dermatologist. But I also suffer from health anxiety, depression and OCD so I am convinced it is melanoma and I am feeling very depressed right now."

"Hi doctor,  I am having pain in my right testicle but it is a dull pain and it is hard to pinpoint exactly which side but I would like to say it is my right testicle that gets swollen and also has that fullness feeling in the entire sac. It normally flairs up every single morning for the past four months and I seem to have an increase in sexual dreams since it has been happening. It is not the worst pain in the world but it is discomforting. I really do not want to see a doctor as it is very embarrassing for me. Throughout the day, it will become swollen and sometimes not. Hot baths and masturbation are the only things that help with the pain. I normally have to masturbate every single morning to take the pain away. I do feel like I can feel something down there on my right side behind my testicle that feels like a smooth tube (not sure if this is normal as I also feel it on my left side, but it is not as big on my left side). A few other symptoms I have experienced with this are lower back pain and nausea. But once again, this has been ongoing for four months now. Can you help me? I am currently on Melatonin and Allegra."

"Hello doctor, I am a 17-year-old female. I was diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel syndrome last year but the pain started before that. At that time my hand only hurt when it was bent to a certain position, and it hurts when I am on my fours or when push-up position. It did not hurt when my hand was squeezed or doing hand exercises. The doctor prescribed me with Etoricoxib (Arcoxia) 60 m which I took twice a day for a week and told me not to move my right hand. I tried not to use it as much as possible but since it was school time, it required me to use my hand. After the medication was over, I was not able to come back to the hospital (even though I was told to if the pain did not go away) and talk to my doctor about the condition of my hand. Now, my hand, specifically the palm of the thumb, started to hurt even if it was not bent or I am in a push-up position. It is more painful when it is squeezed. Our place is quarantined and I am sure getting appointments will be hard during this time, so I am trying to relieve the pain at home. But still, I want to have some instructions from the professional. I have 10 Arcoxia pills here at home, should I take it to relieve the pain? Should I follow the initial instructions of my doctor and take it twice every day or just take it whenever I feel pain? What should I do?"

"Hi doctor, I had my lower right side first molar extraction about a month ago. My dentist prescribed a course of antibiotics. The pain persisted after I finished the course of antibiotics and so the dentist again prescribed a five day antibiotic course. A week went by with no pain and then the pain re-occurred. My medical doctor prescribed a third course of antibiotics now. I fear that there is an infection under the gum line that is not being addressed by the antibiotics. Since I started the latest course of antibiotics, the pain is on and off. When I have the pain, it bounces around even to the head. I feel there may be some nerve damage when the tooth was pulled. I am taking Clindamycin for this issue. Also, I am on Insulin for type 1 diabetes, Cyclobenzaprine, Levothyroxine and Lisinopril. My regular dentist wants me to see an endodontist, on the theory that one of the neighboring teeth is infected and their solution is to do a root canal. I hear that the root canals are a bad idea as a dead tooth is left in place to seep bacteria into the body. If possible, Can I get an antibiotic injection at the site of the infection? Please give me your thoughts. Thank you."
"Hi doctor, I caught Lyme disease two months ago. I had a 7 hour long vomiting session with it. Since then, I have had tingling in my arms, legs, hands and feet. A month ago, I started having kaleidoscope vision, followed by a medium headache. This is now happening three or more times a week and lasts for about 20 minutes. It starts as a small circle or a line, like a cut diamond first and then it goes colored, which expands until it takes most of the vision. I cannot really see anything at this point. I feel as if the esophagus is blocked when I swallow food. I have never had migraines in my life. My mother has MS. What could cause these visual disturbances and tingling? I am on Sulfasalazine, Melperon, Leflunomide, Pantoprazole, Thyronajod, Vitamin D, B12 and Shilajit. I have Chiari malformation of about 12.78 mm at last measure, psoriatic arthritis, lupus, gluten sensitivity, herniated cervical disc, fibromyalgia, bone cysts and spurs, restless leg syndrome, wrist degeneration and cartilage too."

"Hi doctor, I have recently visited ER due to sob. Then, I was diagnosed with a pleural effusion of left lung. Blood work and urinalysis completed during the visit showed normal values. I had chest x-ray and CT scan, which confirmed such and revealed a mass in this area. I went to medical center the next day for pleural fluid drainage and subsequent sample analysis. The sample results from fluid were clear and the drainage helped with breathing. I just returned from the medical center following the biopsy of that area. My radiologist indicated that the biopsy area was more shallow than he has experienced with other patients. I would appreciate your thoughts. I am currently on Lopressor and Losartan. I had not experienced breathing issue prior to this and it recently occurred just two weeks ago."

"Hi doctor,Today, I took my 4.8 years old daughter, who is about 13 kg weight and 94 cm height, to a free growth screening camp. The Doctor has suggested the following laboratory tests. LFT, KFT, TSH, CBC, P/S, ESR, vitamin D3, TTG, IgA level, urine and stool routine. She has also prescribed Bandy Plus 10 mL oral suspension to be taken before sleep and again the same 10 mL dosage to be repeated after 15 days. She also told us to show the test reports within one or two days for further advice on the growth of my daughter. Since, Bandy plus contains Ivermectin and Albendazole, I am little bit scary. Further, my height is 168 cm and her mother is 158 cm. We are much worried about the growth of my daughter in terms of height. However, she is very active and one of the best students of her school in sports, study and all other extracurricular activities. We humbly request to guide us whether all these pathological tests and medication as stated above are in line with the problems or not."

"Hi doctor, I am 27 years of age. I had gone to study in abroad. I was extremely lonely there. I am a huge hypochondriac and when I started getting sleep problems, I started thinking I had some fatal disease. Subsequently, just three months ago, I somehow became convinced that I had schizophrenia and vigorously started searching about my symptoms on the internet. I started feeling extremely detached from my surroundings and from everything around me. I also started feeling detached from people. Nowadays, I feel extremely scared of any noise made by inanimate objects around me. Even a running air conditioner scares me, though I know that it is a non-living thing. It seems as if I have lost the ability to process things. A bird chirping scares me. While I know it is a bird chirping, I still get scared of that noise? A newspaper moving in the air scares me, even though I tell myself that it is a newspaper. I know this does not sound good. My question is, is there any possibility this is not a psychotic illness? Could this be anxiety or depression? And if it is a psychotic illness, is it possible that it might go away and not last like schizophrenia? Will I ever be able to work? Please help me."

"Hi doctor, I have recently been tested positive for Chlamydia, which I believe to have contracted around 3.5 years ago. In the past one year, I have been to the doctor for the following symptoms. Increased menstrual pain, dull pain during ovulation, yellow discharge, sickness during menses and one-sided pain for a few days after the menses. At that time, I was given medication to ease the blood flow and pain. However, now I have been tested positive for Chlamydia. Due to the fact that I must have had it for three to four years with no symptoms until the last year, I believe it has developed into PID. I am taking a course of Doxycycline 100 mg and Metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 2 weeks which my GP gave me. However, he does not believe I have PID. I am going on a holiday next week and will be exposed to sunlight a lot. Should I hold off taking the antibiotics during this time? What are the chances I have PID? I am worried about scarring of the fallopian tubes and infertility. Would an ultrasound detect scarring if any?"

"Hello doctor, I am a type 1 diabetic and have been injecting insulin every day for years already. With this current quarantine going on, I gained some weight which made me worry. Although my BMI says that I am on the normal side, it still made me upset because the belly, arms, and legs have gotten bigger. So I started doing minimal resistance training and changed my eating habits for three weeks already. I noticed that my legs look leaner but my upper body is still the same. This made me anxious because it might have something to do with my insulin medications and I cannot go to an actual dietician since they were still on quarantine so I thought someone might be able to help me online. I am hoping to hear from you. This would really be a big help to my overall health for the rest of my life."

"Hi doctor, I have been having abdominal discomfort for a while. At first, the discomfort was in the flank portion. I went to a urologist he gave me muscle relaxers and a few tablets for clearing any small stones. The discomfort went away after taking the medication. But after some days may be due to sex or workout am not sure, the discomfort returned back. I went to the doctor again he suggested a CT scan. CT scan results showed a lot of stools in the bowel. He said to maintain a healthy diet and add more water and fiber and do some exercises if the problem persists he asked to check with the general practitioner. I had an appointment with my family physician who said the discomfort can be due to lack of bowel movements in the colon. He asked me to take a fiber supplement (Metamucil) after taking it I had clean bowel movements and I felt I was relieved. Of late, I stopped taking the fiber supplement for a couple of days I started having hard stools. Again I called up the doctor, he said no harm in taking Metamucil. So I started it again and drinking at least three liters of water. I am doing like he said to have clean bowel movements. Sometimes the discomfort switches sides left or right. At times my backache as well. I told the doctor and he said it can be chronic constipation can go for many days. I sense my stomach or colon may getting inflamed as the day goes by. After bath everything looks normal. But as day goes by I feel like stiffness or inflammation in the stomach. I am worried because this is been there for like starting January and not going away. There is no real pain but it is the discomfort and inflammation that disrupts my day to day activities. Please advise. Should I book an appointment with gastroenterologist may be to dig further? I read about ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, but I could not conclude anything based on symptoms. I do have an observation that if I masturbate or have sex, after having ejaculation discomfort increases the following day."

I have relationship fears. Nothing in my life provides me joy or relieves me of my symptoms. I had the same feeling six years ago after a break up. Now, symptoms return easily when in fear of life.

"Hi doctor, Three months ago, I had a heart attack. Then, I went through angioplasty with stenting. Post heart attack, I was diagnosed with moderate systolic HF with EF at 35%. Currently, I am on Clavix, Rozucor 10 mg, Tide 5 mg, Metocard-XL, Planep 25 mg and Telma 20 mg. I am improving well. My EF has improved to 40% on first follow up after a month. I have lost about 6 kg to 7 kg weight in the last three months. I am under excellent diet control and daily walking about 70 minutes. I gave up smoking completely. One week back I had my blood checked for various profiles and regarding which I have a few queries. My lipids are on the low side that is total cholesterol 123, HDL 23 and LDL 61. I was on Rozucor 40 for the first one month and then I am on Rozucor 10 mg. Am I below the target range? If yes, can I get the dose reduced further? My uric acid is high 8.1. I read that this may happen due to hypertensive medicines, particularly diuretics and ARBs. Is the high uric acid a point of concern? Should I consult my treating doctor? My kidney profile with sodium and potassium are within limits.My BP is constantly on the lowest average of 90/55 mmHg with heart rate of 65 to 72. Can I reduce my medicines, particulary diuretics? I am worried about the side effects of diuretics on the kidney. My alkaline phosphatase is at 131, just 3 points above the higher limit of 128. Is it fine to have this reading post myocardial infarction? Please explain."

"Hi doctor, I am 27 years old. I have PCOS and have been trying to conceive for four months. My gynecologist put me on 500 mg of Metformin thrice a day and 10 day cycle of Medroxyprogesterone at the beginning of each month to force ovulation. The medication is working exactly as it should. I get my period every month and I have lost weight with the Metformin. I went in for a follow up today and my doctor recommended that I sign up for an infertility study that she is doing. It requires hormone shots, extensive testing and in vitro fertilization every month for a period of four months. I have been going to the same gynecologist for many years and I know her pretty well. Let me just say that she has never seemed like she puts much thought into diagnosing and treating me. I had to practically beg her to test me for PCOS even though I have had very irregular periods and other symptoms for years. Now, she jumped straight to IVF treatment. I have heard of women staying on this course of treatment much longer and being able to conceive. In vitro is incredibly expensive. I am just worried that the only reason she recommended this is because she wants another participant in her study. Your advice on this subject would be appreciated. Thank you."

"Hi doctor, I just found out that I am pregnant (5th week). At first, I was excited then I realized that I went into a very hot sauna (90 degrees) celsius for one and a half hours when I was around 4 weeks pregnant (2 weeks from conception). The whole point of the sauna is to detox, and I definitely was overheating (sweating and red-faced). I did however take two breaks where I jumped in cold water to cool down. Anyways, I read that overheating when pregnant can cause horrible neural tube damage that can lead to birth defects especially in these crucial early weeks when it is forming. My question is how worried should I be? Should I go to a specialist for this? Is it so bad that I should consider termination? My first scan is at 12 weeks and that is the only time I will be able to ask anything and I will be worried it is too late."

"Hello doctor, I am a 36-year-old male. I have been having a problem with urine leakage for the past few months. After I urinate, several drops of urine oftentimes leak out. It has left a small spot on my jeans a couple of times. It happens even if I wait a minute and try to force all of the excess urine out. I have also noticed a drop in the tip of my penis occasionally when I am lying in bed. I am wondering if this could be caused from anxiety. I have had an extreme amount of stress over the past year, which I believe has caused me to have some muscle twitching. But I am also wondering if all of this could be caused by a pinched nerve. Also, because of the stress, I gained approximately 20 pounds a few months ago. At 5’-11” I am 182 lbs, which is just barely overweight. Could this cause this problem? Could this be caused by either stress, a pinched nerve, or weight gain? Also, do I need to be concerned about prostate cancer?"

"Hello doctor, Since after the holidays last year, I have had a hard time sleeping due to some external factors (light, noise, etc) as well as marital problems. Eventually, it got to the point where my hands started shaking again, I stated feeling numbness in my feet, my eyes move very fast sometimes--these are all symptoms I experienced when I was taking Phenobarbital and Phenytoin four years back, my neurologist changed the Phenobarbital with Levetiracetam, and together with Phenytoin, the combination worked very well until I started experiencing these symptoms due to the lack of sleep). Also, a weird sensation that I had, at one point I felt as if my brain was growing bigger and bigger inside the skull, and it got to the point where I was experiencing pressure and eventually headache. After almost six months of lacking sleep, I feel as when I was taking Phenobarbital and Phenytoin: I have problems getting an erection, I lack the energy, I feel sleepy throughout the day, and I experience all the symptoms which I only experienced with Phenobarbital. I really want to get back to how I felt when I started the treatment with Levetiracetam. Are there medications that could replace both Levetiracetam and Phenytoin--or maybe just the Phenytoin? Could the Phenytoin be taken out of the treatment completely? Please, help me."

"Hello, due to the pandemic I'm not allowed to visit a dermatologist in person. But my skin has changed for the worse drastically. Im a 16 year old student, but my face now looks old because of the following: So I had some dark spots cause from acne scaring and I decided to use the ""AMBI skincare fade cream"" which I thought would work wonders but it left a red, darker, larger spot on my forehead, chin, and sides of cheeks. So I let it be for a few days and it was still the same, so then I decided to look u some home remedies, and I found that garlic not only fights acne, which I have on top of the scaring (which looks horrible) but it also fights dark patches, so I applied that on my face and it burnt... A LOT, but I thought that the burning sensation must mean that its working its magic but, noo. the next day my skin was irritated, and red. Now fast forward to today ( almost a month and a half before the incident) my forehead is wrinkly (but it could also be thin forehead hairs) (oh also my forehead was affected the most, because I put the majority of garlic on that area of my face ). I have huge drak- yellowish, brownish patches all over my skin, plus some acne. Ive TRIED homemade recipes to lighten your face, but they haven't been working, then I tried boosting my melanin, and collagen, but still nothing, and now I'm using anti wrinkle cream, but from doing all of these things I don't see any results, heck I actually see it getting worse, My mom told me to give it time, but I'm not sure that would be the best approach. Please help me."

"Hello doctor,I crunched a hard piece of ice a week ago and those few teeth (left corner teeth) were a bit sore since but starting sunday the pain became increasingly intense (I put a solid clove in my teeth for about 30 minutes and it helped the pain but as soon as I took the clove out the pain returned). This has caused disturbance in my sleep for the past few days. Monday majority of the tooth pain went away (a few teeth still slightly hurt but not bad at all) but now my entire left side of the face is swollen and it became worse overnight (under the eye, nose, and top lip) something in my gum hurts but there is no pimple or bubble there. I have a slight fever (but it is not bad) and my left ear hurts sometimes. Sounds like an infection but I do not know why. I want to blame this on the ice but it is odd that the prominent pain started so long after the incident.How long will this continue and what is the best at home treatment? Should I see a dentist (I have been trying to avoid it because of COVID-19). Is this a serious issue or did crunching the hard ice just trigger an infection somehow?"
"Hello doctor, I recently fell off a roof. After ER visit w/ct scans and X-rays I received 7 staples in my head and was discharged. Prescribed Cephalexin and Percocet I went home for recovery. Two days ago while coughing I felt an excruciating pain what seemed to be under and behind my lowest rib on my right side. This pain continued only when I strain myself such as with a cough or sneeze, etc. Since beginning this pain has gotten more intense with each involuntary strain."
"Hi doctor,  I was diagnosed with genital molluscum contagiosum (about a month and a half ago). I am being treated now and there are few number of bumps left (less than 5) when it first appeared there were 8-9 bumps. I wanted to ask if this had anything to do with the HIV virus. I have almost never been in a relationship without protection. But that still made me worry for a while. Please let me know if I should panic."

"When I started paroxetine(paxil) 20 mg for GAD, I had three side effects, two of which were common, difficulty sleeping and a lack of appetite. The two were manageable. As for the third, which was a mild muscle spasms in my cheeks. Feeling like muscle cheeks are sometimes tight then relaxes. This side effect lasted 4 years then disappeared. I think when I started exercising it helped disappearing that. Last year, as per my dr instructions I switched to paroxetine cr 25mg cause the paroxetine 20 mg was out of stock. For 3 months everything was perfect, after which I started to take my pill at night. By end of the month, suddenly I started feeling as if the medicine had went out of my body and taking it again. The old side effects of the cheeks muscles spasm are back stronger, adding to it the neck( back and front) muscle contractions non stop and stiffness sometimes due to the continuous contractions. Next month, only cheek spasms(continuous)disappeared completely. Throughout this period, the muscle spasms/contractions(continuous)were covering all the back and front neck muscles at the same time. Since 3 months ago, I began to feel the muscles of the back neck muscles getting smooth and slight improvement in the contractions. They are getting mild and slow. Also feeling like cracking sound in my back neck muscles maybe due to stifness. Moreover, the spasms in the muscles is now getting isolated. Sometimes back sometimes front neck not anymore all area at the same time. I would like to clarify to you that there are no defects or abnormal movements such as tics or jerking movements in my neck. Muscle spasms or contractions are not visual. Only me who can feel them. Things are improving slowly. It is annoying but I don't want to change meds cause I had very disaster experience with the previous ones. From your experience, how long will those spasms lasts?in case I don't want to change meds, what to do to reduce more and more ?any meds or supplements could be taken with the seroxat?"
Good day  My situation started yesterday after taking a shower yesterday. I climbed out of the shower and noticed I had this high pitched ringing sound in my ears. This sound is really causing me to panic ; last night I has 3 anxiety attacks because of it and I took 50mg Sressam tablet but it did not work. I still have the ringing in my ears today and I've taken another stressam about 1 and a half hours ago but it's not seeming to work. I'm afraid I might have an anxiety attack again tonight because of it. I've recently been placed on Acnetret for my Ance (7 days ago) but my Dr told me to stop it for a few days because I have been experiencing extreme back pain which I am still experiencing right now. I have been off the tablets for about 2 or 3 days and I dont know If this could be causing the high pitch (silence sort of noise) in my ears. Its causing extreme anxiety and unfortunately all Dr's rooms are closed right now.   Age: 15  Male 176 cm  164.8 kg

It got better and I stopped taking Pantoprazole, but I still have epigastric pain on and off. I had an upper endoscopy last week where the findings were all normal except for erythema atrophy of antrum. No more obvious acid reflux signs though. But epigastric pain still comes and goes.

I have not had biopsy results from endoscopy yet, but I am hoping and praying for the best."
"Hello doctor, I had a condom tear while having sex. Two weeks later, I developed symptoms of pain and slight swelling in my right testicle, lower abdominal pain, and foreskin inflammation. Thinking it to be chlamydia, I took 1g single dose of Azithromycin. It provided me some relief but two weeks later the same symptoms arose. Further, my foreskin and penile glans have now become sticky to touch, like a stick note, although it is not moist. I had also developed rashes on my inner thigh. I consulted a doctor who prescribed me T Bact for my sticky and slightly swollen foreskin, Betnovate N for my rashes in my inner thighs, and put me on a seven-day course of Amoxicillin 500 mg for three days. I am on day 5 of this course and my symptoms seem to have eased up significantly, but I fear a relapse could occur like last time. I have minimal abdominal pain now, and my testicles only feel a little uncomfortable from time to time. Further, the stickiness of my penile glans and foreskin has not subsided much, which worries me a lot. I would like to know what is causing this stickiness of foreskin and penis? The swelling of foreskin seems to have reduced somewhat. I am sending you the latest photos as well. Please advise me on what should be my next step."

"Hi doctor, Recently, I had RARP surgery for prostate cancer. My Hb level post surgery fell to 10.8 and I was advised to stay on iron supplement Dexorange Syrup one teaspoon thrice daily after meals. In view of ongoing treatment for erosive gastritis, which is now under control, the Iron supplement was started three months ago. Then, my Hb level has improved to 12.5. I had a CBC, folic acid and iron study and I have enclosed the reports for your reference. I am a vegetarian. Please advise further course of action as I have been advised to stop the Dexorange syrup after three weeks and continue with iron-rich diet. My gastroenterologist is not in favor of long-term usage of Iron supplements. The stomach ulcers due to H.pylori have been treated and stomach lining restored. Currently, I am taking Nexpro 40 mg in the empty stomach and Librax once at night. My CBC report issued an alert for anisocytosis. My amylase level is around 174 U/L, but pancreatitis and bile duct obstruction have been ruled out. I am taking Unienzyme tablet in the morning and night along with one probiotic capsule Vizylac. Please advise if any attention or investigation or treatment required further. Thank you."

"Hi doctor, I have a single gallstone. I am not facing any symptoms but about last week I felt a severe and intense pain in stomach and immediately to back which continues until I had an Decloyran injection. This pain did not spread over the abdomen. When we met the doctor he checked very carefully and said that it was not the pain of gall stone. The doctor asked for an ultrasound and in ultrasound the stone was in its place. No inflammation or fluid accumulation. Gall bladder size was normal. The doctor said that the pain was due to twist of certain veins and is not due to gallstone. I want to ask that whether twisting of vein can cause pain? Is it necessary to do operation? Is there any way to remove single gallstone?"
"Hi doctor, My husband is a 38-year-old male who smokes and has degenerative disc disease from several car accidents. No real treatment has been given to him aside from chiropractic visits to reveal tension in his lower back. He does have many stresses with work and home life and is seeing a counsellor due to depression. About a month now, he has experienced daily headaches that would not go away. Often his headaches are accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He has light sensitivity. And I am sure also working on a computer adds to it. Often he feels the headache and it is manageable. But there are times he feels it more. Just the other day he was having what he said was a cluster headache. He is scheduled for a MRI. But I am extremely concerned it is a tumor or something bad. Any thoughts or opinions would be appreciated. Does Degenerative Disc Disease cause daily headaches?"
"Hello doctor, I have flown very often in the last few years. I forgot to wear earplugs and slept on a few flights recently. On the last two trips, I had multiple flights connecting. I noticed my ears did not stop popping after a few days. Since my last flight, my right ear has not cleared up. It used to be at night my ear would pop and get better during the day. Now my right ear has lost hearing, I would estimate about 50% and fluctuates between 50% to 75% during the day. When it is totally silent, I think I hear this tone in my right ear. I do not have headaches and can sleep fine. I have gingivitis and bleeding gums, and no other health issues. I was wondering if my ear is infected or not. I know whatever I have is connected to my frequent flying every two months for the last five years. I always wore earplugs and never had this before but forgot the last trip. Should I take antibiotic drops? I definitely have mucus in my sinus and I am not sneezing or coughing in any major way just and not sure if I am infected or not. Would antibiotic drops help me rule out infection?"
"Hello doctor, I am a 17-year-old female. I believe that I have hives on my thighs. I have them for about five to six days and they appear whenever the area gets hot. I was using a blanket last night and the hives got red again but when it is cold, they are not red and appear to be my skin color. I used Hydrocortisone the first three days and it helped, and I was also wearing tight leggings while working all day. The last two days, I have been taking Claritin and it has helped because the area is no longer itchy but the hives and bumps are still there. Should I take Claritin tonight too? How do I get rid of the bumps? I assume that I should not keep on using Claritin since I have used it for two days already."

However, in Peyronie's the erect penis gets the hourglass shape with pain but in my case erections are just fine. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I am quite worried."

Since then I have stopped consuming lactose, heavy foods such as cheese, full-fat milk, and paneer since but my stomach is still unsettled a year on.

"Hello doctor, I am a 19-year-old college student. I have been diagnosed with depression two years ago and I have been taking Sertraline ever since. My mental health is a mess right now. I think I have restless leg syndrome and I always have the urge to move my feet and legs especially when I am lying down. Also, I have been dissociating, every once in a while, real life feels like a dream and I sometimes cannot recognize my own face in the mirror. But here is what really bothers me, the intrusive thought of death that cannot leave me at all. I close my eyes and see horrible images and think about death and visualize my loved ones dying.  I have also been having recurring nightmares, almost daily, really disturbing, and often death. I also tend to worry a lot about my loved ones and always feel the need to check up on them. It became like an obsession and I fear losing control and losing stuff. I have a lot of doubt about my spiritual and religious life. In total, I am really anxious and distressed. I now have heavy heartache feeling and I tend to clench my jaws and fists. I also suffer from a restless sleep. Please help."
"Hello doctor, Recently (the last week at the most) my lymph nodes in my neck have been very swollen. When looking at the back of my throat, I can see small tonsil stones, small, but many. There is swelling which I am hoping is associated with the stones and there is a lot of swelling at the top of my right tonsil. The right side of my tonsil definitely is sore but fluctuates throughout the day. I have used tobacco, tobacco-products fairly consistently for the last two years, smoking at most a cigarette per day, and vaping. There are also flesh-colored bumps on the back of my mouth on the left side, they are not painful though. There is one on the top and one down by the tongue. I have not noticed these previously. My depression sometimes affects my hygiene, so I am hoping that this could be the cause of the stones. I have been brushing twice a day, flossing, gargling with salt water, and mouth wash. Since doing this, I have noticed much less swelling in my lymph nodes and a little less in my tonsils. My diet also has not been the healthiest lately (eating about one meal a day) and my sleep schedule has been a wreck. I am just really hoping it is not cancer but I have yet to go see a doctor."
"Hello doctor, I have taken meningitis vaccination for visa process. I suffered headache with visual aura with dreamy sleep and less sleep for three months. I started treatment in India and took Cipralex, and Escitalopram. CT scan was normal. My symptoms relieved for about 80-90%. I gradually tapered off the treatment. Later, mild dreamy sleep problem with mild and sound sensitivity occurs. I did not took any medicine for that. I also suffered from scalp pain in head and treated for three months with Phenergan, and Neocalm plus. I felt only temporary relief. MRI was done in consultation with neurologist. Results are normal. I was on Cipralex 10 mg, Naproxen sodium 250 mg then gradually tapered. After that I am suffering from dreamy sleep all day and localized head pain episodes 2-3 times in a week when sleep disturbed in the previous night. Meanwhile, I was heavily stressed due to family issues and job pressure. Once again I was prescribed the same medicines but I did not take and tried to control it with yoga and meditation. I have mild light and sound sensitivity which is quite tolerable. My major problem is disturbed dreamy sleep and episodes of localized head pain in the scalp only. I took vitamin D, B12, calcium for six months. My elevated triglycerides are due to SSRI 230 mg/dl. At present, I am alright but want to get rid of symptoms. My symptoms are muscle tension and nerve pain. I did eyes test OCT and my eyes are normal. My questions are even if I am not stressed I do not get dreamless and refreshing sleep why? Which is suitable medicine in general? Can Flunarizine cause more deficiency of calcium as already I am deficient? Cipralex and Esclitopram are habit forming but I was very comfortable with that it causes weight gain and elevation of triglycerides so I tapered off to end. But after some time dreamy sleep and scalp mild pain comes back. What to do? Kindly suggest and advise some medicines."

"Hello doctor, I have a 30 -year-old male. I am 5 feet and 11 inches with 75 kg weight. I had difficulty initiating urination and also had a case of erectile dysfunction. The problem with starting urination was many years ago, which I ignored because I thought it would go away normally. I only recently found out about my ED (a few months ago). I have no problem while masturbating. After visiting a urologist, they asked me to take several tests (reports attached below). The report showed that I had a case of chronic prostatitis with a bacterial infection. I was asked to take medication for two weeks (antibiotics) and then supplements for three months. I have taken the antibiotics for another two weeks. I have not been able to go for another checkup due to lockdown. I took Jippo (Azithromycin), and Pantop (Pantoprazole). Supplements I took Revital Care, Neuro Care, Caldoz, Lovaza, and Cholecalciferol capsules (DV 60K). The doctor also suggested me to exercise, maintain nutritious diet and take vitamins for the ED. I have taken two doses of EDSave 10 mg tablets for two weeks. This helps with strong erections. I still feel that the medication has not fully worked because I need to wait for some time to start urinating. I have attached all my reports."

"Hi doctor, Eight years ago, my family and I went on a vacation. When my mother got out of one of the outdoor pools, she started feeling a sting on her arms and all of her legs below the knees.

She does not have any noticeable rashes, but she does say that her skin is extremely stingy and itchy which really impacts her days and some of the sleepless nights that come with this itching.

My AST and ALT levels are high (112 and 113), glucose is 116, absolute eosinophils are 720H. I have attached my lab reports. My guess is, this is liver disease, pancreas disease, or diabetes. Any ideas? Do I have to quit drinking? Or can I cut back? I am currently taking Stelara for psoriasis."
"Hello doctor, I had a CBC (complete blood count) done yesterday and it came back with elevated WBC of 13500, with neutrophils 9000 (more or less), ESR 36, and close to normal lymphocytes. My urine sample was negative. I had a severe eye infection that lasted about 10 days and started clearing up really nicely yesterday. When I had the blood work done, I was crying for an hour due to unrelated massive stress factors. I have severe anxiety and I am going through a rough time, I am hardly ever at ease. I am mentioning this because I read stress can be a factor. I am worried because my levels are elevated and I show no signs of infection apart from the eye (which still has a little pus). I do not go out due to COVID-19 at all. Food is delivered and handled in a very safe way, packages are disinfected and I have no contact with anyone. I am puzzled as to where an infection could come from. My doctor thinks it is a bacterial infection and has put me on antibiotics. I am very worried about cancer. Should I be?"
"Hello doctor, I am a 24-year-old male with no past medical history. I have been facing pain while passing stool. The pain ceases after a few hours. But, it comes again if I sit for a longer duration. Sometimes, I see small strips of blood on the stool. I have been sitting in warm water and keeping ice-pack for some days. It does help relieve pain. On examination, I also saw a small fleshy lobe near the anus. I am attaching a picture of the area."

"Hi doctor, I am suffering from bloating since February and from March I am also experiencing severe constipation. I have tried all dietary change but none seem to be helping me here. For the past few days, I was also experiencing pain in the abdomen, sudden sensations in legs, and mild pain in testicles. So yesterday I went to see a local doctor and done the CBC test. All the parameters in reports were normal except platelets, which were 90K. Without any further tests to know the underlying cause of low platelets, the doctor wrote me some medication. I am really very worried about my health and want to know the root cause of all these problems. Please help."
"Hello doctor,  I am having difficulty in breathing. It is like I always need to take deep breaths. And I think it gets worse after I eat. On top of that, it triggers an anxiety attack most of the time. Another thing is, there is this sensation in my chest, I do not know if is right to call it as tightening or pressure. Usually, when I stand up it somehow alleviates that sensation but the breathing difficulty is still there. Sometimes all of the symptoms go away like for hours but then it comes back. I think I am having these symptoms for three weeks or a month now. I am doing self-diagnosis and I do not really know which of these is it, costochondritis, angina, GERD or COPD. That is why now, I am seeking the help of a professional. I just hope it is nothing serious."

"Hi doctor, I keep getting boils on my abdomen once every two to three weeks. They are painful and leave behind scars. I have been having this condition for the past two years. Earlier it was severe with new boils occurring every few days and now it has become less frequent. My local dermatologist diagnosed me with recurrent furunculosis and treated me with topical and oral antibiotics courses repeatedly. But after the course was complete the boils returned back in a few days. I was also made to do a two-week R-Cin course. Can this condition be something else? Also what is your recommendation for preventing recurrence? I am attaching a picture of the latest boil I got yesterday on my abdomen."

I feel like I am breathing into a tight chest with constricted chest wall muscles along with shortness of breath and throat tightness.

"Hello doctor, Eight months before, I felt a small lump around the right side of my anus area, (before I had itching around the anus for several months). Later that lump became larger and painful in a week. I consulted a homeopathic doctor and he gave me medicines (Paeonia off Q, Acid muraticum, Acidum nitricum), I took that medicines, and the lump wound burst in three days. But that wound skin has not dried yet, and it still watery, it also feels itchy sometimes. Besides this issue, for a week I am feeling another small lump on the left side of my anus area, and I feel like sure it would become big and painful like the previous one. So I need your consultation to cure it forever. And these wounds appear externally around my anus."

"Hello doctor, I have a cm sized lump on the glans of my penis. It appears to be under the skin. Therefore I ruled out the possibility of it being a Fordyce spot which I appear to have and are usually on the skin. It is slightly raised while flaccid but really shows in definition when aroused. I seem to have a similar definition around the start of the glans and end of the shaft, which I have had for some time. When I move the skin these lumps it do not move at all, unlike Fordyce. I suffered with bad eczema on my penis when I was a young child and used creams to heal. I do have trouble retracting the skin as it is tight and I am not sexually active. However, I do masturbate usually two to three times a week. I wanted to know the possibilities of what it could be? Should I be worried? Can I treat it myself if it needs treatment? And should I stay away from any sexual activity during this time?"

"I have a grade 3 sprained ankle. Im male, 5""9, 160lbs. I had severe swelling to the size of a softball the first day, aswell as bruising that started to appear overnight. On day 4 I went to the doctor and got xrays. The doctor determined it was a grade 3 sprain but gave me a projected recovery time of 3-6 weeks which is the recovery time for a grade 2 sprain.

"Hello doctor, I have a question. On Tuesday I went to go get tested with my fiance for COVID because we thought his dad may have had it since at his job there were so many infected. We showed no symptoms but to be safe we went. After then I have not seen him just in case. Today I got my results and I was negative but he was positive. Does that mean the virus can still get to me?

"Hello doctor, Since about a week and a half ago, I have had tinnitus in my right ear. This was after self irrigating the ear with one of those squeezy syringes that come with the Otex ear drops. Before doing this, I was putting in oil drops for about a week prior. Quite a bit of wax came out, but now I have this hissing noise in my ear which gets worse when listening to podcasts and music at low-medium levels. It also seems to become more pronounced when I chew. I have had a subtle amount of ear pain over the past week but that seems to have gone now, but the hissing sound has not improved at all. I am worried I may have applied too much pressure when squeezing the ear syringe and have damaged my eardrum. I was wondering if this will heal over time and the tinnitus will go away? I cannot go see a GP due to Corona, so an opinion would be much appreciated."
"Hello doctor, Over a year ago, I scheduled an appointment to try to understand why I was rapidly losing weight. My gastroenterologist ran some tests and did an upper endoscopy as well as a HIDA scan. The upper turned out negative for all tests however the HIDA scan reported that my gallbladder was functioning at approximately 40%. My GI then recommended a cholecystectomy as my gallbladder was not functioning properly. He did also suggest that I could try to repair it with my diet but then told me it would likely be fruitless and I should get the procedure right away. I did so promptly and experienced the typical symptoms. I am concerned about this only now because I believe I have postcholecystectomy syndrome due to the surgery. This would not be an issue relatively however I believe that my rapid weightloss was due to extreme stress and was mostly psychological. It seems to me that my practitioner should have advised me that gallstones occur commonly when rapid weight loss occurs. Furthermore, I believe that I could have benefited much more from keeping my gallbladder on a rigorous healthy diet and prescribing a biliary control. The latter that has taken place has resulted in a year long constant struggle to be happy and healthy."

"Hello doctor, I had an STD test done five or six days after unprotected sex with a new partner. The tests came back negative, but I have learned that you should wait for different windows of time before getting tested for certain STDs. This was about seven months ago. Today, I went to my gynecologist to get tested again (for chlamydia and gonorrhea) to ease my mind. She said that the original tests were likely accurate given that just barely enough time had passed to be tested, but suggested to get another test for peace of mind. I did not think, until after my appointment, to ask if the Doxycycline I am currently taking for my acne (100 mg, twice daily) would alter the results? I am wondering if the results I get in a week's time will be accurate? And if you think the original test was likely accurate in the first place?"

"Hi doctor, I am having severe mental problems and I cannot concentrate on anything. I am a civil engineer and working in a private firm. I am married and have one child. I am unable to take my wife with me because of financial issues. My wife got pregnant last year and since then I have stayed alone. Due to excessive sexual desire, I have approached many prostitutes, but only after spending lots of money I got physical satisfaction. Mental desire was still unsatisfied. Nearly one year, I went through many troubles in my jobs, including court case and money loses. Since then I have changed three offices, but did not receive proper funding from the company. I was all alone with less or no friends. I searched in dating sites and found a girl, who is a professional sex chat agent. She made a personal contact with me out of her job scope. In less than a week's time, I feel like I am in love with her and cannot live without her. Now, she is having some financial problem and seeking money from me for providing sex chat services. She is not a fraud and somehow I can manage to give her that by taking a loan on credit card and something. I am in constant touch with her since last 7 days and I have yet not done any sex chat because my mind did not allow me to ask her for sex. I am thinking about her only and not be able to concentrate on my work. I cannot get rid of the problem and cannot take myself out of the situation. I am seeking help in this regard. Thank you."

I feel as if my heart is going to stop beating from fear, anxiety and panic attacks. I do not really know the reason. I just need something I can do in order to relax from these symptoms. My flight is after two days and I really do not know how and what will happen. Before a year, when the severity of the depression was stronger than now, I did not breathe and the emergency staff gave me oxygen. How to make myself relax? I am really trying to calm down. I am telling myself not to fear and relax without thinking anything. Please help me."
"Hi doctor, I am a type 1 diabetic. I have been prescribed Evista as I have precancerous cells in my breasts. I have had multiple biopsies done in the past 5 years and they were always benign.

"Hi doctor, I have some kind of allergy on the head of my penis. Please tell me how to resolve it and which doctor should I consult. My age is 25. I did not consult any doctor before this. I do catch a cold in a month or two and I skip my diet many days. I saw this allergy a month ago when my girlfriend got tonsillitis after having oral sex. She said it was because of this. It has still not resolved, I thought it as nothing much and it is in the same manner since then. I do wash it regularly and I use to masturbate too much."

"Hi doctor, This is regarding the personal health of my husband. I am suffering from a very bad sex life due to very low sex interest of my husband. To tell about the past, we had a long courtship period of 1-1/2 years in which I was able to understand from his conversations that he has very low interest in sex. I ignored that and got married to him. Right after our marriage, we had sex daily and then it started reducing gradually. The frequency fell drastically from having sex once in a week to once in 15 days. Whenever I tried to initiate or have a word with him about it, he said that a man needs to be very free to have sex and busy people generally have low sexual engagements. I know that it is not true and I believe that he gives some excuse to his own weakness. Now, at the end of one year of our marriage, the sex has reduced to once in a month. So, you can understand the level of frustration I have landed into, which is severely affecting my own personal health and interest in staying with him. He hardly gets aroused once in many days and does not react sexually even after I make advancements. He does not react, does not understand and most importantly, not able to enter me without putting a condom. He says he gets support with the condom. So, the second issue you can understand is that with that condom I cannot conceive also. He has very low interest in anything related to sex and he is not able to enter me properly as he says it hurts him. Otherwise, he is such a loving husband and its tough for me to believe that he does not want to make love to his wife for any other reason. I would like to tell you that he does not have a separate skin from the shaft, it rather covers the shaft and that pretty much indicates he even masturbates very less. Could you please help me? Could you please tell me if this is normal with some men? Does the case of my husband look abnormal? What are the tests that he must get done to affirm that he suffers from sex issues or low testosterone? What line of treatment should I take him to? Thanks in advance. Please help me as this is ruining my personal health and would probably push our marriage to the end of divorce as my family knows about it now and does not want me to stay in a marriage with a man who cannot keep me physically happy and still not accept he has some issues. Thank you so much."

"Hi doctor, I do not have any health issue. But, I am not in mental peace with my close friends. I do something that is unintentional and it bothers my friends. This creates a sense of agony in me; it bothers me a lot as I overthink. The issue can be very small and negligible, but I think that one of my friends uses me monetarily, may it be a matter of a very small amount. I am often embarrassed amongst them, but this is because of the reaction of the other people."

From last two weeks, he is getting pain on the left side of the tongue and we consulted the doctor again. Doctor said that there is no possibility for further operation and radiation therapy. He suggested that he needs to go for chemotherapy only. Though we opt to go for chemo, his body is not able to support. He became very weak as he underwent surgery, radiation and chemo already.

"Hi doctor, I have been experiencing flare-ups for weeks now. I do not know if this has something to do with the change of weather. I have been having trouble sleeping lately since I am very uncomfortable right now. I am using Cetaphil gentle wash and shampoo because my scalp gets itchy as well. I am using Elica ointment and somehow it helps me with some of the areas that are not really that worse, however, the uncomfortable feeling is still there.

"Hello doctor, I am 58 years old. I have some very minor tingle in my right second toe. I am very healthy with no medicines and no other symptoms. It started with unilateral tinnitus. MRI of the spine showed moderate to severe stenosis spine. I do exercise, and running, and my neurologist says this might be normal. I had a concussion when I was 17 and spent a day in the hospital. My MRI brain is obviously abnormal with white matter. What is the likelihood of MS? I had an MRI in 2015 and said chronic microvascular changes. MRI of a couple of weeks ago said no tumor on auditory nerves. Please explain."
"Hi doctor, I am a 21-year-old healthy male with no underlying conditions. Today about six to seven hours ago, I was getting a haircut and the barber had the cape/blanket around my neck pretty tight and so I asked him to loosen it and when he did, he yanked it back before unbuttoning it and it choked me for a couple of seconds. The cape was lying on above my Adam’s apple so I know it got pressed inward. There is not a lot of pain just discomfort like the feeling after getting choked. It was not intentionally done hard but it might have been the angle and where it was lying because it is a bit uncomfortable right now. If I take my mind off from it I do not feel it but as soon as I am remembered I feel the discomfort. Wondering if I had any damage permanently or if it is just temporary discomfort?"

"Hello doctor, I had a miscarriage two months ago resulting in a Dand C at 10 weeks. I am now pregnant (4 weeks and 3 days) and taking 400 mg Progesterone suppositories once per day due to low progesterone levels both in the last pregnancy and in the weeks leading up to the confirmation of this pregnancy. However, my doctor has told me that my estradiol is very low, and that is concerning me. My results so far: 14 DPO Hcg 69 U/L Progesterone 77 nmol/L Estradiol 220 pmol/L. Two days later: 16DPO (yesterday), Hcg 129 U/L, Progesterone 75 nmol/L, Estradiol 239 pmol/L. Is my pregnancy doomed because of my very low estradiol? I was hoping my doctor would prescribe estrogen medication but he does not seem to think that would be an option. Why would he decide that? Do you think estrogen supplementation would help? Instead he is having me take 25 mg daily of DHEA. Do you think this will help and is it safe to take in pregnancy? Will eating foods high in phytoestrogens e.g. soy help increase my estradiol? Also, do you think my low Hcg levels are a bad sign? At 12DPO they were 15U/L so they increased rapidly to 69U/L on day 14 but then slowed a bit to get to 129U/L on day 16. I am due for another blood test tomorrow. I really do not want to lose this pregnancy, but these low numbers are making me worry."

"Hello doctor, I have ED problems for about a year. I am 22 years old, healthy, active, no other physical health problems. A possible reason for this is I had a bad case of blue balls on a night and was not resolved until the next morning. I believe this may have affected my veins in my testicles. My ED may be mentally too, like libido, but I do not think that as much as a physical problem with blood flow. Please help. I did a test with that gel stuff on testicles and x-ray type thing and they said nothing wrong."

"Hello doctor, I am 25 years old. I suffer from premature ejaculation. I have always had it in the sense if I am aroused, I ejaculate within the first 20 to 30 seconds and if I am not aroused, it can take longer, but still less than two minutes. It feels like I am always forcing myself to ejaculate, and perhaps this started with me masturbating in my early teens. Would counseling solve this issue, or is it more serious than that?"

"Hello doctor, Approximately 4 months ago, some mild pain started in my right shoulder joint but i have not taken it seriously. It started bothering me since end of February and it was slowly worsening. I daily travel by crowded trains, approximately 25 km to my workplace and back. By middle of March, while travelling (by standing) in train holding overhead handles my shoulder was hurting with every push from the crowds at various stations. During day time, there was not much pain I felt, but in the night, my sleep was disrupted frequently with pain (like pulling with a hook) on the shoulder. I applied ""DYNAPAR QPS"" (Diclofenac Diethylamine and absolute Alchohol Non-Aqueous Topical Solution). My mother was using it for joint pains and she asked me to try it but I got no relief with it. Then my cousin practicing Homeo medicine advised me some Homeo medicines and it provided only a slight relief. In the 1st week of April, I consulted an Orthopedic (Joint pain/bone specialist) and had taken X-ray of my right hand in 2 different positions. He suggested it is due to frozen shoulder problem and advised rotation of hands, shoulders, neck, etc., along with some medicines (mainly pain killers and anti-acidity medicine). Even after taking it for 25 days, still I am having pain, mainly in the inside bend of the right-elbow. If I raise my hands straight, it hurts very little, but if I bend it to comb my hair or putting my hands through the sleeve of my shirt it hurts very badly. During day time, the pain is very minor but in the night after the sleep of an hour, it starts paining badly. What I assessed is, while the weight of the upper body rests on the shoulder or around the area (including back side) while lying down, the pain radiates from this region and it hurts mainly the shoulder joint, forearm muscles, elbow joint and the wrist. After trying various positions to rest the hand and shoulder with pillows/soft towels, the pain eases little and I fall asleep again. This repeats throughout the night. I use Laptop extensively at work and at home also. Sometimes I feel a pulling pain in the wrist when I use the mouse more, but no problem with key board. Now I am working from home due to Covid19 lockdown, but afterwards, I may have to travel again by train and I am scared of the pain I will have to suffer."

"Hi doctor, I am trying to find out a specific function of the diaphragm when it comes to taking a deep breath. There seems to be a deep breath one takes similar to when one is at the doctor and they say take a deep breath and then there is a much more satisfying deep breath one can take which seems to fill the upper lungs with much more air. It looks like the diaphragm (upper belly) moves out a little bit when this deep breath happens. Can anyone explain the mechanics of this? Why can this deep breath happen sometimes and not other times? It is as if I could hold a musical note for 3 minutes because their is so much O2 in my lungs."

"I have symptoms of a high-pitched sound when I move my jaw up and down while eating, yawning and even when I turn my head sideways to the affected side as well as grinding the teeth. I also have fullness/pressure in the ear when the jaw is motionless. I have now had these symptoms for more than 6 months. I went to see the doctor last week who thought it was due to the jaw joint although there is no pain or soreness and recommended that I see a stomatologist but she didn't think it was because the Eustachian tube is blocked. I also had an x-ray performed on the jaw a few months ago and it said that the left mandibular condyle is positioned very slightly in front of the most pronounced point of the temporal condyle. I went to see the stomatologist a couple of days ago who said that I have costen syndrome. He said the two sides of the mouth were uneven when I bite and therefore he chipped at three teeth on the right-hand side to balance it since the sounds were coming from the left ear. I will see him again in 3 weeks' time to see if the mouth is even and the symptoms from the ear have disappeared. He also mentioned that I would need a night guard temporarily. Will the symptoms of the high-pitched sound when I move the jaw up and down and the fullness/pressure in the ear eventually disappear?"

"Hi doctor, My father is 90 years old. He has congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is generally in good spirits and is well taken care of. He uses oxygen and his doctors have told him that when his oxygen count goes down, to breathe in and exhale through mouth. Since his breathing is generally weak, after every time he walks or climbs stairs, he sits down with this oxygen tank and breathes in slightly and then exhales, usually with more force than he inhaled. I am trying to teach my mother about pranayama and the importance of exhaling through the nose. Her concern is that the doctors have taught them the breath in through nose technique and exhale through the mouth. Given that he is 90 with those conditions, on oxygen, is there a reason that he should use the technique the doctors are recommending? Would it be more beneficial to breath in through the nose and exhales slowing through the nose, even with the tubes in his nose? The latter makes more sense to me but since my mother only trusts her doctors, she asked to get more information about this. Thank you so much for your time."

"Hi doctor, I used to spend a lot of time before laptop and tablet. Now, my vision became blurred when I see a computer. I had a headache in exactly one part or one side of the brain. Then, I had a check up and everything was found normal. The doctor suggested me to take capsule Eyetamin for 20 days. Then, I was fine without any problem for approximately a month. But, again, developed the same problem. Now, they prescribed me with a glass (spherical, ARC and -0.25) along with Oxycool eye drop and some medicines. It was good till now. Some 15 days back, my vision became blurred and I had a headache, though I had my eyeglasses. Both were gone after I had some sleep. I had the problem while I was studying. I used to study continuously for 3 hours to 6 hours approximately a day. I again had a check up and they did not find any problem. Eyeglass specifications did not change. They prescribed me with Zoline plus eye drop. Even after 10 days of use, I do not feel any significant difference. After application of the eye drop, I could not see properly for some time. After some time, it was clear. Now, I could watch television continuously. I am having problems while studying and I could not study continuously even for half an hour either from a textbook or on laptop. I am having eye strain. I fear my vision will become blurred again, so have stopped reading since last 15 days. Please suggest what I should do now. I will be grateful for your advice. Thank you."
"Hi doctor, Last year, I noticed hair fall. Then, I had a surgery for appendix and post surgery my hair fall increased severely. I have checked vitamin D, B12 and ferritin levels. Everything is normal. Since, I am a vegetarian my doctor put me on some multivitamin tablets. I am also taking biotin tablets for two months. It has been a year, but nothing helped.

Till now, I did not observe any change. Also, it has started making my hair dry and brittle. Please tell me what to do further?"

"Hi doctor, I wake up with pain in the kidney region every morning after approximately three to four hours of lying in the supine position or on my left side. The pain localizes beneath the left and right kidneys, more on the left and down toward the pelvis on the left side. It hurts the most when inhaling. My body wakes me up in a 10/10 pain every morning as a survival necessity. If I elevate my mattress by 15 degrees with my head higher than my feet, I do not wake up with the pain or it is suppressed approximately 90%. When I get up and walk around for several minutes, the pain goes away. I never experience the pain when I am not lying down. There also seems to be hyperintensities in both the cecum region and renal pelvises. I found the intensities in the cecum region to be upwards of 3071 compared to my bone intensity measurements averaging around 1200. I have testicular pain following urination, sometimes cloudy or semen like urine following the pain. I am unable to completely trace both the ureters without their disappearance and they both seem to be compressed in various regions. I can however find them again around the bladder. I understand that dilation is absent on the CT scan, however the pain only arises after hours of laying down so it would seem to make sense that dilation is not visible on the scan. Also, there seems to be an intense, vascular network posterior or underneath the kidneys that I have been unable to identify. The duodenum appears to be compressed by the SMA and the right testicular vein appears to be compressed by the duodenum. I need your help to review these issues. I feel like I am dying. I am 25 years old. This has been occurring for more than two years. I have extremely itchy skin all the time, probably due to urinary leakage or fistula or vascular issue. My identical twin brother does not have any of these issues. I do not think that I can go much longer. I have attached the reports for your reference. Please help."
"Hi doctor, I have had good skin for all my life. People would even compliment me on it at times. This changed a while ago. I have been involved in bodybuilding for the last year and decided to start taking creatine roughly three months ago. Before that, I did not notice any effect of exercise on my skin, except some small pimples on my chin area. After a month of creatine usage, I realized that my skin was getting worse with some breakouts all over my face, forehead and temples and especially chin and low jawline area. I first removed the protein supplement from my diet thinking it was the cause and only 1-2 weeks later realized upon the research that creatine was the real culprit. I instantly stopped taking it and the only supplement I take now is natural, dairy free protein powder. Along with the skin care regimen, I follow this every day. I am using a cleanser along with moisturizer twice a day and it has helped almost to clear my forehead and temples. I assumed my breakouts were due to dehydration in the period I was taking creatine, but only noticed slight progress in my chin area. Although, the bumps on my skin now do not feel as tough and dry as they did and do not itch anymore unless I forget to moisturize. I drink lots of water and have just bought a 97% pure aloe vera gel tube that I am going to apply twice a day. I am afraid whether this condition could last a long time after quitting creatine. I am really worried as it is seriously damaging my confidence and overall wellbeing. Is there anything I need to know or anything I can do on my own to help the healing process? Two weeks ago, I decided to take a break from working out and thought that I noticed some improvement, as in decreased redness but I do not feel too sure about it. But, I would really hate to quit work out."

"Hi doctor, From when I was 17 years old I have used tanning beds on and off up until I was 22. I was not aware of the risks. Through the internet I learnt about the risks. I got to know that it is inevitable and that will develop melanoma at some point. Do most people who use tanning beds end up with melanoma? My skin looks and feels healthy and I only have about four to five moles on my body and a few freckles. Melanoma does not run in my family. I have green eyes, but tan very easily. I rarely ever burn. Are my risks still very high from my tanning bed use? I did not notice any change in my moles at all and I now use sunscreen every day."
"Hi doctor, I am a 30 year old female and planning for a first pregnancy. Thereby across, I came to know about rubella test.

If yes, then how long should I avoid conceiving?"
"Hi doctor, For the past 10 days, I have been having frequent bowel movements. At first, it started with lots of pain, but the pain got subside after relieving my bowels. The stools were softer and of large quantity. No blood in stool, but a little bit of red color on my toilet paper. I have hemorrhoids, which I know and I have been impacted by all of this. I went to my regular doctor and had an abdominal CT scan last week. I have not received my results yet. I am getting pain to the right of my belly button a few times. After about five or six days when the frequency of going to the bathroom slowed down, I seemed to strain a bit more to go and the stools were coated in white. This would only occur with the harder stools. The other stools seem to be softer and more yellowish in color. After the CT scan, I am of course going to the bathroom frequently, but no white in stool at that time. So, my concern is the mucus which I have never had before. What is causing the diarrhea? Ironically, I had seen my gastro doctor when all of this began. So, I have scheduled another appointment. I had a colonoscopy two years back, all normal except for hemorrhoids and an upper GI at the same time. Gastritis was the only thing found. Since then, I had an abdominal ultrasound and pelvic ultrasound, in which all were fine. Could colon cancer develop quickly? I am a worrying and I am driving everyone around me nuts.

"Hello doctor, I went for Doppler scan because I feel a small tiny seed inside my scrotum sack. The scan says everything is normal. Nothing is found, testicles are fine but it says mid-left hydrocoele found. Doctor said, no need to worry and it is no cause for alarm and that I can drain it if it got bigger. I went home. After five days, I notice a swelling that is not round in shape and close to the left testicles. The urologist did another scan for scrotal Doppler. The report is the same as the first one. Only a left mid hydrocoele was found. The doctor said, he is surprised that the scan has not picked up varicoceles. Because he noticed left varicoceles when he feels it. I can feel the right varicocele is small than the left varicocele. He asked me to go to another hospital for a scan and mostly they should check for varicoceles. Surprisingly, the third Doppler scan for scrotal in another hospital seen nothing wrong, and the investigation was normal. The urologist says, since the three reports have picked up nothing and no varicoceles are found, he could not operate on it. That this is because the varicocele is not large enough to cause problem for the Doppler to see. I asked the doctor whether I should go for a semen analysis to see if the semen is normal. He says that is a good suggestion to rule out every suspicious of varicocele and my sperm count is normal. I ask him about the swelling close to the testicles, he said, that is normal and I should relax and it will not affect my testicles. Do you think I should be relaxed about this? Is the doctor right? I have a very loose scrotum sack. Is this normal? The scrotum sack reduces in size only when I feel like using the toilet to pass out stools. Is this normal?"

I have been experiencing anxiety, depression, irritability, and anger which is very out of character for me. It has taken some time to pinpoint, but it seems like these behavioral changes may correlate with when I began taking the medication.

Since I have been taking Levetiracetam, I have not had any more seizures or auras. I am happy the medication is working, but I am interested in advice about other possible medications or non-prescription treatments."

"Hello doctor, I am a 35-year-old male. No episodes of herps except chickenpox in childhood. No Infection of HIV, clinically tested every six months for the last seven years. My partner and I both are not having HIV (clinically tested). I had a bacterial or fungal infection with pus and redness in the genital area. So I have done the blood test. HIV is negative. HSV-1 IgG 4.5 positive. HSV-1 IgM 0.29 negative. HSV-2 IgG 0.45 negative. HSV-2 IgM 0.69 negative. As HSV-1 is mostly non-genital infection. I did not have any episodes of HSV-1 type herps in my life. I never had HSV-1 type herpes anywhere in the body. I am straight and have a relationship only with my spouse. How can blood show HSV-1 IgG positive without any symptoms? Dermatologist says it is due to past infection and not about present infection. Doctor told I should take antiviral dose Acyclovir for 20 days for HSV-1 IgG past infection. Is it useful to take antiviral dose for the past HSV-1 type infection? Will it reduces IgG level in the blood? Is HSV-1 IgG is false positive?"

In the event of this, I have been masturbating three to four times a week to relieve my urge for sexual excitement. However, lately, I have noticed that while masturbating my erections are not that rock hard like a couple of months back and even the force by which I used to ejaculate has drastically reduced and my sperm does not come out in force but just dribbles out of my penis on orgasm. I have no sort of medical problem or diseases and lead a normal diet without any medicines. My wife's gynecologist had once prescribed CoQ LC and Fertisure M medicines for me. However, I need your advice as to which medicines I should take and the dosage to overcome my problem and even get ready to make my wife conceive naturally."

"Hello! I am currently in my withdrawal bleeding week (placebo pill days, I am on birth control). Yesterday, I noticed two abnormal clots on my pad. I have experienced blood clots, but these were different. A little difficult to explain (I have a picture), but they were large and white, with visible blood vessels on the surface and a blood ""string"" at the end. Again, a little hard to explain in words. Because of my current circumstances, I have not taken birth control the ""normal"" way in the last two months. Early last month, I did not have more birth control at the end of my placebo week, and was only able to start a new cycle of it the following week. I did not know I should only start the pill at the beginning of my cycle. Once I found out, I skipped the placebo week the following month in order to reset the ""ovulation""/placebo timings. I am sexually active and, knowing I had not used the pill correctly, I mostly used condoms as backup. I was wondering if these clots could be a result of messing up the pill or if they are something I should worry about. Thank you for your help!"

"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well."

"Hello doctor, I am 29-year-old, married male. I have a baby who feeds on breast milk. I had a sexual encounter before 8 months with a professional with a condom. I am 95% sure that my protection was intact. Then I started reading about the HIV symptoms and technicalities of testing online. Five days later, I went to a Dermatology and Venereology specialist and described about the incident. He was confident enough that he advised me not to go for any testing. Although my fear of infection remained. Around two months post-exposure, I felt tenderness here and there like on the back of my head, arms, one lymph node in my underarm was swollen and I developed cold and cough. I started sweating during that time as well. I looked a bit thinner. I got panicked and went to the doctor again. He checked me and was still confident that I am not infected. But for my mental satisfaction, he prescribed me thorough testing which includes HIV1/2, VDRL, HBsAg, HCV along with urine R/E, M/E, C/S analysis. On 74 th day post-exposure I took all those tests and they all came back negative. After lapse of a few days again I felt some skin irritation on theback and burning sensation on my forearms. Although no skin changes can be seen. Again I got panicked thinking that I may be in the window period for HIV. But the doctor remained confident and he adivised me not to go for any repeat testing. But my sense of fear, anxiety, panic, guilt, and impurity continues. On 110th day post-exposure again I repeated the tests but I excluded the urine analysis this time. All the tests came negative again. The HIV tests were fourth-generation combo test both the time. I am on the eighth month post exposure. Still, I feel tenderness hear and there. Recently, I am developing small red blood vessel like dots just underneath my skin on my hand and feet which is staying for 5-7days and going away leaving faint black spots. I again showed it to the same doctor. He is confident and repeatedly asked me to stop worrying. He also gave me anti-anxiety, anti-OCD, anti-depressant drugs. I am also taking sessions with a psychologist. But still, my mind is not free from the fear of HIV and also fear that my wife and child might get infected by me. My questions are, do I need to repeat any test to out rule the probability of HIV? Are there any probability of error from lab test given the fact that I took the tests twice? Do I need to worry about the window period as there is conflicting information available on the internet? Do I need to worry about the phenomenon of delayed seroconversion? Do I need to opt for the tests from a different lab? Do I need to worry about HIV 1/2anymore? How to unroot the fear from deep inside my mind? Any other opinion on my history?"
"Please give me a meaningful response as i cant aford to reply and i am scared that i am slowly losing my hearing or something. I have had tinnitus in my ears for about 7 months now and it sounds kind of like T.V. static and its not loud so its okay, but today my phone emited a very high pitch sound and i closed one ear and then opened it and closed the other ear and noticed that i could hear the high pitch sound much better in one ear then the other. Could this mean im slowly losing my hearing. About months ago i got a hearing test done, but i dont have the results, but they said my hearing was amazing. Even now i have no trouble hearing at all. So what is happeing with the high pitch noise. Why can i hear it better in one ear then the other?"

"Hi doctor, I get cold sores about every 2 years over the past 15 years and they go through the five stages of healing which take about 10-14 days to heal. Over the past two years, I have got two cold sores that have not completely healed. One was before a year and the most recent one was in February of this year. They are faint but apparent to me and every time I move my lips, eat, have hot food, shower, sweat, or just about do anything I can feel them on my upper lip. I have been to multiple doctors and two dermatologists. I have been prescribed Valtrex, Tacrolimus, and medicines for the pain. I have used many over the counter medicines such as Neosporin, Abreva, Hydrocortisone, Vitamin E oil, face cleansers, tea tree oil, Aquaphor and kept it moisturized and clean throughout. Nothing has worked or even made a slight difference. I get the constant tingling and it is not super painful but I can feel it there as if it has not healed or subdued. My current dermatologist has suggested a biopsy but I am not sure if that is the next step. If it is not a cold sore or cannot be healed with what I have been prescribed I nor my dermatologist have any idea what it could be. How I can be rid of it? Please help."

"Hi doctor, I am a 22 year old male. My weight is 180 lbs and height is 5'10"". I was prescribed a generic brand of Adderall 20 mg about a year ago. It truly has improved my lifestyle. Up until about two months ago everything was fine. I noticed that on the left side of my neck became red randomly. I would describe it as looking more like a heat rash that starts around my collar, goes up only on the left side of my neck. It extends to my left ear and sometimes I get some redness on my left cheek bone. It does not itch or bother me in any way, but it is very noticeable sometimes. I have not been able to find any other factor that could be causing this. I have tried not eating particular foods, changed my laundry detergent, etc. My older brother and I both get a redness in our face when we play sports and this has happened every since I can remember. I do occasionally smoke cigarettes and have tried different brands to see if that may have a factor, but nothing. I have been to my local doctor and they have said that it is probably allergies, but I just do not agree. I am not allergic to anything, but I have not got around to getting an allergy test since the redness appeared. I am very concerned about this and more embarrassed. Thank you for any advice."
"Hi doctor, I have just started fasting from yesterday morning and last night I was having slight kidney pain. Then I awoke in the middle of the night with some kidney pain and a swollen kidney feeling and urinated with difficulty like having to really push it out. Similarly, last year my kidney got worse when I was fasting. When I was under 1 year of age, I had an operation on my kidney and have a large scar in front of the bladder or abdomen area. It was a blocked urethra, which caused whatever fluid back to the kidney causing damage. They said that my kidney would have to get removed at one stage in my life and 21 was the oldest patient in the past that lasted before removal. I am now 30. My height is 183 cm and weight is 85 kg. I wanted to know if it would be advisable for me to stop fasting and if so would that be for the rest of my life?"

"Hello doctor, I am a 38 year old male. I was diagnosed with bilateral glue ear. It has persisted for two weeks now and has seen an ENT specialist. I am on my third dose of antibiotics, Moxiclav duo forte 875/125. The condition does not seem to be improving. I am also using painkillers, nasal spray and antihistamine. I am keen to get grommets in my ears just to get some relief as the pressure or fluid buildup is unbearable on occasions. The ENT specialist seems to be against doing this? What would you recommend? Please explain."
"Hi doctor, I am an 18 year old male. I have been experiencing a wide range of symptoms for nearly a year. It all started in the last summer. I started to experience constant vomiting after eating, bloating and weight loss. Then, I was diagnosed with a Dientamoeba fragilis infection and given a course of antibiotics. I thought I would get better after this, but that was not the case. I was treated for the bacteria and I still have symptoms like occasional vomiting, a lot of weight loss (15-20 pounds), bloating and abdominal swelling. The doctor did a bunch of blood tests and said he did not see anything wrong. The vomiting stopped, but I still experience the symptoms and not gaining any weight. So, my doctor referred me to a gastroenterologist. I told him about my symptoms, which are as follows. GERD, weight loss, occasional abdominal pain, abdominal swelling and bloating, malnutrition, alternating diarrhea and constipation, and heart issues like racing heart and heart palpitations. My sister has celiac disease. My gastroenterologist has done an endoscopy and said he does not think that I have celiac and he said Helicobacter pylori might be a possibility. I am really worried because I have got a lot of blood tests and everything came out fine, except Vitamin B12 and D deficiency. So, I just want to know if you think that I could have Helicobacter pylori. I am really anxious. Please explain as soon as possible and share any other possible illnesses that I could have based on my symptoms. Thank you."
"Hi doctor, I have been diagnosed with bilateral varicocele grade II and III. My urologist recommended microscopic varicocelectomy after reviewing my test results. I am 32 years old and all of my blood test results, including hormones were in the normal range. However, my semen analysis showed that there are approximately 34 million sperms and out of which 60% are of good motility that is approximately 20 million. My semen analysis from 6 years ago was nearly 90 million sperm count with 60% motility. I understand that my current sperm count is at the bottom of the normal range. Me and my wife are not planning to have kids for the next one or two years and have not tried yet. My doctor recommends the surgery because there is going to be some improvement in the sperm count if he performs the procedure. I prefer to avoid the surgery if not necessary. I have a few questions. Is the sperm count going to be significantly different three years from now after performing the procedure? Is there a downside with leaving a permanent suture in my body for the rest of my life? What happens to the permanent sutures if the veins shrink or get absorbed by the body? I am not comfortable with leaving an external object (silk in my case) in my body for the rest of my life, especially if it causes problems in the future and I have to remove it later on. I am a highly active person and play soccer and go to the gym regularly. I am not sure how experienced the doctor should be for this procedure. My doctor is relatively young and obviously less experienced. Please help."

"Hi doctor, I am suffering from anxiety around the health issues, cancer and tend to obsess about things. I have been fixating on my breasts and keep thinking I feel lumps. My doctor suggested to get an ultrasound four weeks ago for my peace of mind and they were perfectly fine. Tonight, I was scratching and then prodded to the left of my nipple on my right breast. If I push firmly down I feel a small knot or pea like thing. There seems to be two and one is more prominent. I can feel something vaguely on the left side of my breast but not near a prominent. Am I right in assuming? As I had an ultrasound only four weeks ago and everything was fine, whatever I am feeling might be some muscle or something. I have to press quite firmly to feel it. If I just do a normal breast exam, then I cannot feel it. Also, if the scan was fine four weeks ago, is it possible for a cancerous lump to grow in that time frame? Sorry, the anxiety is tough to deal with. Please help."

"Hi doctor, I am 24 years old. I am suffering from a neurological disease and due to this I am getting weak day by day. My toes are gone almost numb since last two years and the same things are now happening with the upper limbs. I had this disease from childhood, but in a progressive state. So, with time my health degraded constantly. It started affecting my lower limbs. Now, I cannot even walk or stand properly. Now, it started affecting my upper limb as well. I cannot lift heavy objects due to weakness in grip and cannot do any manipulation by fingers quickly such as typing, writing, etc. I have been treated in various hospitals since my childhood. Currently, it was predicted as vasculitis neuropathy and getting treatment accordingly. I have gone through various treatments till now, but unfortunately nothing worked. Now, my doctor suggested me an injection called Rituximab, which can possibly stop the growth of this disease. The two dosages of this injection are quite expensive and due to this we are worried that how much safer is this injection to me. Hence, I thought that I should take an opinion from you before taking this injection. Could you please suggest me your opinion by looking at my attached reports, Is there any possibility to cure this rare disease or at least to stop the growth of this disease?

"Hello doctor, I had a problem with lower left abdominal pain for 7 years which is diagnosed in 2017 as an umbilical hernia. I subsequently did the surgery in January 2018 and I was diagnosed with moderate fatty liver during the test prior to the surgery. But I was given Liv 52 to take for three months and Lipitor 20 mg. But when I reported to work I started noticing mild pain in my heels and imbalance which I thought was due to the drugs side effects. Somewhere in March I panicked out of sleep and started sweating with my heart beating very fast. I rushed to the hospital and they did a brain CT and kidney function test which was normal and the gave me some anxiety tablets Lexotamil 1.5 mg. Afterward, I noticed that my heel pain was aggravating with flashes of dizziness and minor headaches which I could manage. I reported to the hospital and was referred to an orthopedic specialist. There I was asked to do and MRI of the brain, neck, and spine with magnesium, phosphate, calcium, and sodium test which were all normal. The doctor then gave me Renerve and Stugeron for the dizziness. But still the issue persisted so I reported back to focus and was asked to see and ENT specialist and EYE specialist. I went to an eye center but they all proved negative. So I was referred to see a neurologist who asked for an MRI of the thoracic and lumbar spines and also test for Folate and Vitamin B12. But again they were all negative and he said my situation might be idiomatic so he did not give anything. But in all these, I realized my energy levels were coming down I easily get tired and occasionally my heart rate will go up with a feeling of uneasiness and confusion all coupled with balancing disorders associated with cluster headaches. I went back to my hospital and was advised to see a cardiologist. He also did his relevant test which all proved negative and he declared me safe. But he advised if I am still not normal I should see his boys at the executive heart center which I did. They have been working on me since and nothing has come up. Although the symptoms still persist. So just last week I was not feeling very well and had to go for a check up when I was told of the micro-pulmonary embolism and was admitted. I currently have serious heel pain without swelling in the legs, dizziness without spinning, chest discomfort, unsteady gait, muscle weakness and extreme fatigue, diminished vision, issues with acid reflux and indigestion, occasional heart palpitations, insomnia, and pressure and discomfort in the chest after standing for about 5 minutes or while walking with extreme dizziness. I currently take Xarelto 15 mg, Motilium once daily, Stugeron 25 mg, Maalox plus suspension 150 ml, Pariet 20 mg, Carvedilol 6.25 mg, and Lexotanil 1.5 mg once daily at night."

"Hi doctor, I am a 21 year old female. I was bulimic for about a year. It happens once or twice a week. I never noticed any permanent changes in my eyes throughout my episodes. However, the last time I ever binged and purged three months ago, I vomited violently. A few weeks after this, I noticed that the vessels in my sclera are indefinitely more prominent than before. Did this happen because of the continuous pressure subjected to my eyes with vomiting? Or could it just be due to many hours of reading and laptop use? I have seen an ophthalmologist and he said that there is nothing wrong with my eyes and suspect a very mild case of blepharitis or bilateral dry eyes. I am using Optive comfort solution. I would like to know if my bulimic phase could have caused the prominent vessels in my eyes, as this has not been mentioned anywhere else online."

"Hello doctor, I have twins, a boy and a girl aged 2 years. I noticed that the girl advanced in skills than the boy. In the first few months of life, my son was faster than his sister in the growth and everything. And then, it was reversed. I am a graduate of psychology. I have a brother suffering from autism and frankly, I have a fear of this disease. I do not care and I do not want to surrender to delusions. But, mom and dad insist on reminding me of everything you see them that my son is also the possibility of getting hurt. I started since 10 months; I am watching my son very much. I blame him if he did not implement what I am asking. He says dad and mom. He loves to play, laugh and shake hands if I asked him to do so. He looks into my eyes when I talk, but I do not feel that he understands what I am saying to him always. For example, if I asked him to bring me cheesed off the table, he does not focus with me and ignore me. On the other hand, if he feels he is thirsty, then he will come to me and say a bottle of water. I know this is probably because the rate of a normal IQ and concentration varies from one to another child. I want a word from the doctor that makes me serenely scream in the face of all of the notes that my son is not normal and I tell them that my son safe and sound. The question is how completely I know that my son is not suffering from any problems in communicating diseases or behavior?"
"Hi doctor, My friend has been having left shoulder pain for months. For the last three weeks, he is also having the hoarseness in his voice (can barely speak) and little energy.

Is it a sign of pregnancy? Can I consult a Gynecologist alone without parents or guardian? Can I terminate the pregnancy by medication as it has been only 6 days? What should I expect? Please help, I am stressed."

"Hi doctor, I have had a bad cold sore 8 weeks ago on my top lip and a bit of the skin above it. I used Zovirax externally 2 weeks course and Acyclovir 2 weeks course to treat it. The actual sore improved, the blister stopped weeping, the scab formed and flaked off within 3 weeks but the redness is still lingering. I rung the doctors that put me through a pharmacist who told me to use Hydrocortisone 1 % cream. I used it for a week as he recommended but it still did not go away. That was two weeks ago.  I also had a new flare up three days ago. Also on the top of my lip symmetrical on both sides. It looks different to a cold sore in that it was some redness and skin flaking.  Home remedies I have tried so far: Aloe vera (not much help), Tea tree oil (irritated it), Manuka oil (helps healing where the sore is but seem to irritate the new flare up), Coconut oil (irritated it), Almond oil (seems to soothening it at the moment). I am worried if this is still unresolved herpes/cold sore and can be transmitted to my partner who does not have herpes. Is it contagious and am I able to kiss my partner?"
"Hi doctor, I took Benzodiazepine Alprazolam for insomnia for 2 months for a total dose of 30 mg, while stupidly attending college parties and binge drinking once a week during the period (I have never taken the pill on the day I was drinking). I did not take the drug every day and after roughly two months I quit the drug altogether, the withdrawal, that I did not recognize at the time, kicked in (Extreme tinnitus, sweating, heart racing, heightened anxiety). I went to ENT doctor and she gave me two Dexamethasone injections in 3 days (I think 8 mg). I developed during these 3 days a major loss of short term and then long term memory, trouble finding words, trouble learning in general. The physical symptoms of the steroids and benzo withdrawal went away in 2 weeks. It has now been a month since I feel physically fine, but the cognitive issues persist and they do not get better at all. I have been to a psychiatrist because I felt overwhelmed that Iam not going to be able to finish school in such a state and she gave me Escitalopram thinking it could be psychological, but there is no improvement in cognition after a months use. Does that combination have that drastic side-effects and could it caused a chemical or structural problem in brain? What can I do to return somewhere close to my old self? I am 24 years old."

"Hello,  I'm looking and would like to discuss my treatment options for my conditions.  I've bipolar disorder II, social and generalised anxiety disorders, panic attacks and agoraphobia due to it.  In past, I used escitalopram, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, sertraline, lithium, depakote, quetiapine, risperidone, anxiolytics. Venlafaxine was effective but had to discontinue it due to high blood pressure it caused. Other treatments mentioned didn't work for me. Anxiolytics worked, but now i don't have such options to continue this treatment because I'm getting used to Tranxene.  Currently I'm taking Lamictal 200 mg and 10 mg olanzapine.  I am afraid to go out from my flat, I am constantly alarmed, nervous, anxious, can't eat because of constant lump in my throat. Anxiety is debilitating, I can't work outside my home. At work I get so anxious that I have to take some free days from work, if I don't do that, I vomit from this anxiety.  1) Can duloxetine be effective? Is it common that it can increase pulse and blood pressure as Venlafaxine did? 2) How long does it take for escitalopram to take effect? 3) Can prozac decrease anxiety? 4) Is paroxetine an good option for me?"

I usually masturbate four to five times a week, sometimes I can go two to three days without masturbating. I have cracking noises in my hips and knees and my quad muscles feel over stretched and tight. This problem has affected me and I am very limited in performing any activities such as sports. I am not physically active anymore, I used to play sports regularly but since I started having so many problems from the waist down, I stopped. Also, I get pain even when I am standing, sitting, or driving and get pain in the morning after waking up. I live abroad and to get any medical attention requires months of waiting. I currently have an MRI booked in five months but my symptoms are getting worse day by day and I do not have the patience to wait until then. Is masturbation the reason for my problems? How can I fix these issues and get my life back to normal? Is MRI necessary? If not, what do I need instead? Please help."
"Hi doctor, My last period was on 25th February 2020. I have done urine test twice at home and it is positive and I do have other symptoms of pregnancy. I am sure that I am pregnant. Due to Corona situation, I am afraid to get out and do other tests and see the doctor. I do have a dry cough for the last one month and some time with white mucus. Mostly when I eat rice, and spicy food my cough starts. I have called a gynecologist and she told me to have Adovas after lunch and Duvent (Rupatadine 10 mg) after dinner for seven days. After seven days, I called her and told her that I feel a little better but not stopped coughing and she advise me to take Adovas only three times a day. I did and it did not help me at all. I called her again and she advises Montelukast 10 mg after dinner and its also not working. It has been four days since I took Montelukast and I feel like I need to deep breath when I take it. I have only cough, no fever, no pain, no breathing problem, no headaches, and no running nose. As you know in this Corona situation I cannot go out with a cough to get other tests or see a doctor for my pregnancy advice and lab test. Would you please help me advising good medicine so my cough stops. Other than the above, I am taking Folic Acid 5 mg two times moring and evening as she told me do I need to take anything else for my pregnancy at this moment. Please help."

"Hello doctor, I have had ED for several years now. I am able to get an erection but I am unable to maintain it. I have been going to a men's clinic for seven months now and they have done the GAINSWave treatment and implanted a testosterone pellet last week. After all this, there has been no improvement. I have been using the ICI injections and that maintains the erection. Sildenafil is effective sometimes, but not consistently. I have also improved my diet and exercise. I also have delayed ejaculation during this, but in the last 10 days, I am unable to ejaculate at all either through sexual intercourse or masturbation. I have been on SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) in the past but stopped taking them six days ago. At this point, I am at a loss and would like to get another opinion and some direction."

"Hello doctor, I am running an IT firm for the past four years. Currently, I am having two health issues related to my work. 1. Lower back pain - it started two years back and now it has become worst. Now I cannot ride a motorbike, cannot sit in a normal chair, and cannot even sleep on my sides. I also cannot walk or stand continuously for more than half an hour. Currently, I am using a belt and it is helping a lot. 2. Pain in both the shoulders if they are not in action. Like if I am sitting in the chair for more than an hour without regularly using my hands. The shoulders start paining. This just started a few months back and getting worst. I have not consulted a doctor yet for both of these issues. I wish to book an appointment and it would be appreciated if the doctor knows Malayalam as my English is not up to mark."

"Hello doctor, I am 24 years old. I have always been very anxious about health, especially my sexual health. But when I was about 9 or 10 a spot came up on my penis where the glans and shaft meet. It was flesh colored, painless, and round. There was no dimple in it. I was never sexually abused or sexually active at this age. I did not even masturbate the first time until I was 12 or 13. My mom took me to the doctor and they said like just come back if it gets bigger. She had likened it to a wart, but it was not very hard or dry. Anyway, it stayed for a couple of years after that it shrinks down. It no longer appears as if it is above the skin but appears as a small pin-sized bump underneath a skin bridge. I am curious if it cannot be an STD and I have never found anything similar online. So what could it be? I would not think a wart would stick around that long. And it really does not look like that at all. That was there over 12 years so I would not think it is anything fatal. To be even more specific, it is on the top side to the right. As I said, it looks like a skin bridge with a little bump underneath. But it really has no sort of texture. And the only problem it really causes is some skin rubbing when that extra skin rubs my underwear."

"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old female. I have checked my pregnancy test on the 8th of this month and my last LMP was on the 5th of last month. I have consulted the doctor, he confirmed my pregnancy and prescribed me capsule Gestafine 200 (Progesterone soft gelatin 200) one capsule per day for 15 days and Folvite 5 mg one tablet per day for 15 days. After a week, I found some brown discharge. Then, My doctor did a scan and said that the baby growth is not well for the one month of pregnancy. She said that there is a 50% chance of miscarriage. So, she prescribed Aspirin gastro-resistant tablet IP 50 mg one tablet per day for 15 days and Tranlok-E two tablets per day for three days. As my brown discharge did not stop, again, I went to the doctor. She has done an ultrasonic scan and told me that the baby has started to grow. Now, she prescribed IM HUCOG 5000 one injection, IM Susten 200 one injection, Tranlok-E three tablets per day for 5 days, Duphastone 10 mg three tablets per day for 10 days, Susten 200 one tablet per day for 10 days, Folvite 5 mg one tablet per day for 10 days and Aspirin gastro-resistant IP 50 mg one tablet per day for 10 days. As of now my brown discharge has stopped. I tried to approach you this time, because on the internet I found that Tranlok-E is prescribed to stop uncontrolled bleeding in menstrual periods and it is not mentioned for pregnant women. Since, I am pregnant, I just want to confirm whether there is any side effect in the above mentioned tablets. Shall I continue those medicines?. Please help me."

"I am 29 years old, a mother of a 17months toddler. Two years ago I was suspected to have fibroadenoma on the right breast by a doctor who's only done the ultrasound, because I haven't accept to do the biopsy. On the report it is written by the doctor Ultrasonographic bilaterally dense glandular parenchyma, on the left side there are no signs of apathological echogenicity, on the right side is seen lobule hypohehogenic focus of 16mm suspected of fibroadenoma. Since then I haven't done any ultrasound at all, and haven't used any kind of medication because the doctor haventw prescribed me anhthing and recently I feel pain before the period and then after having the period I dont feel pain. But now that I am on the fertile days, I feel pain a lot when touching it, and I can feel that there is a thick lump near the nipple. Moreover, now I can feel I have lumps also on the left side when I touch it, and it's painful, but the right side is more painful, and this didn't happen to me before. Just to add that I am still breastfeeding. I want to do another ultrasound but until then I need your answer about these questions: 1. I don't have family history with breast cancer, except the aunt of my mother who had breast cancer. Is it possible this is cancer and not fibroadenoma? 2. What kind of a diet should I have to cure this disease? 3. I am afraid of biopsy, I've heard that it is dangerous because when you get a part of the lump removed,(and if that is cancer) the rest of it will be shared all over the body. Is it true? 4. Should I stop breastfeeding and can I plan for another baby after some months or I should better do a surgery before then? 5. Is it possible that I feel this pain these days because of the fertile days I am going through? Thank you a lot"
"I'm a 21 year old male and take no medications. 4 years ago I started having Vasovagal Syncope episodes that have increased in frequensy over the years and I have now passed out from it around 10 times. My triggers for it are blood, needles, and damage to the wrists. My clinic reccomended that I wear a heart monitor for 30 days and when I passed out it showed that my heart stopped for 11 seconds and I was told to visit the E.R. I went to the nearest one and the cardiologist there informed me that my heart stopping that long was dangerous so they wanted to put a pacemaker in my the following morning. I redused and went to another hospital and they did a cardio ultrasound, told me my heart was fine, and then their cardiologist said that my heart stopping for that long was normal with Vasovagal Syncope and that I would be fine and let me go home. Those are 2 very different opinions and I wanted another. Should I be worried about my heart stopping for that long and is there any risk in it?"

"Hello doctor, I have had issues with my left ear for the past two months. I normally clean my ears with peroxide. After I added drops of peroxide back last month, I noticed that when people spoke to me loudly I would hear wind sound in my ears. Also, my ears felt plugged and I heard thumping (heartbeat sound) in my ear. Two days ago, I attempted to clean my ear with a home irrigation system. I was able to dislodge a large piece of dried, white wax. My ear felt the best in a long time. I was hearing clearly and the sounds in my ear went away. Yesterday, my ear felt plugged again. So I irrigated my ear and nothing came out. But the plugged feeling and sound went away. This morning my ear felt plugged again, and I irrigated my ear and nothing came out. But my ear felt clear and the plugged feeling and sound went away. What is causing this issue? Why does it keep coming back?"

"Hi doctor,  I am 34 weeks pregnant and my baby's choroid plexus cysts did not clear. We did the genetic testing in the early stage of pregnancy and it was negative for trisomy 18 and 21. We had four growth ultrasounds, but no one reported anything else wrong with the baby. I am scared that they did not look well enough. Now we are moving to a different state and the doctor there said that they would have done additional screenings (amniocentesis, talk to a specialist for cysts), but that it is too late now to change anything. She said two cysts (one on each side) are more characteristic of Down syndrome. I have pictures that they gave me from the ultrasounds. Is there anything specific that I can look for on those ultrasound pictures that would indicate trisomy 18 and 21?"

I ended up sleeping at 5 AM. I was wondering if you had any tips to help me not be afraid to sleep at night."

"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

"Hello doctor, I have a headache in my upper part of the head. I do not know if it is connected with my neck because I had stiff neck due to my sleeping position. Well I lay down to bed most of the time due to quarantine and after I had that stiff neck I had this. It is not actually a headache, I guess it is like irritation in my upper head. I do not know if it should be treated with a pain reliever. As it is not that severe I did not take it."
"Hello doctor, I hurt myself two days ago and it seemed to be getting better. But today it is worse than when it started. Most of the pain is in the right side area. Today, I cannot walk due to excruciating pain. The only relief is laying flat on my back or standing at the foot of the bed and bent over with my face on the mattress. As said, I was doing better the past two days but yesterday I laid flat down on the bed while my husband rubs my legs and I was propped up on my forearms and I am wondering if that did not make things worse. I felt pretty good when getting out of the bed and during the shower and then the pain started to come back and quickly accelerated to not being able to even sit in a chair due to excruciating pain. Again, as long as I am lying flat I do not feel it at all but if I try to move side to side I feel excruciating pain."

"Hi doctor, Before two years, my father was diagnosed with prostate cancer and has been undergoing treatment using Eligard and Xgeva. Early this year, he got diagnosed with vallecula carcinoma and for which he underwent chemo (Erbitux) six sittings and radiation therapy for 27 days. While vallecula seems to have subsided, he is now detected with tumor in some of the lymph nodes and for which operation has been recommended by the doctor. Also, as observed in PET scan cancer seems to be spreading to other parts as there are some areas highlighted in the lower part of the lungs. Doctor has not given clear guidance about that. We have been exploring the other options to retard spread of his cancer. We need your guidance on therapies that can be considered to extend his healthy life span. He is 73 years old.

"Hi doctor, I have attached my two ECG reports here. Are they normal? They were taken consecutively, 1 minute apart, the one with 106 heart rate was taken first and the second one with 93 heart rate was taken later). I see some broad peak in the second one. I am not sure if it is an error or something else. My questions are as follows: Do both ECG charts represent healthy heart? The reason why I went to the hospital is that I felt chest pain and I checked my heart rate by a phone application. It gave a normal reading except for one time it gave 39, but immediately after that it gave 79. Do you think the 39 heart rate is an error? Should I feel relaxed and be assured that my heart is fine? What is that broad peak? I have very mild mitral valve regurgitation that was diagnosed to not have any treatments. Also, before I did the ECG, I just ate and I was very concerned about the chest pain. Please explain. Thank you."

"Hi doctor, Today I noticed two moles on my back with large dark circles around them. I have attached the photos of one affected area only. I have always had these moles, but have never seen these dark circles until today. I have had biopsies of moles from my back before and they were not cancerous. However, in the past, my dermatologist and a plastic surgeon removed a pre-cancerous mole removed from my right calf and a suspicious mole from my right bicep. My mother had a melanoma removed.

"Hello doctor, My son is 21 months old. He is suffering from very acute diarrhea. That is four to five times in an hour and frequent vomiting, four times a day from the last four days. We consulted a local doctor. He advised the attached prescription and stool test. As per him it is due to severe bacterial infection in the stomach, which is resulting in diarrhea. My son is not suffering with dehydration and his fluid intake is sufficient. He himself is asking for food, but due to frequent motions, he is weak and the rashes makes him irritated. Please give your suggestions. We are worried as it seems that medicines are not healing it in a faster way. He got only 5% relief in three days. Doctor said that it will take three to four days to become normal and stool test is also fine."

"Hi doctor, I am on Prozac treatment for two months now for depression and anxiety. I am on the minimum dose (half a pill a day) and I am doing very well to this treatment. However, I just found out I am pregnant. My gynecologist says that I should stop Prozac immediately, but my psychiatrist says keep taking them, as it is a very low dose and it will not harm the baby. My anxiety and panic attacks were quite bad before. Now I am much more relaxed and I am just feeling like a normal person again. What should I do? Should I continue the treatment? Is it safe for the baby? Please help."
"Hi doctor, I am suffering from unilateral headache for the last two months. I had an eye examination and that was fine. My blood tests were all normal. I have seen three doctors, my GP and two hospital doctors, who all say it is likely a benign headache or tension-type headache of some description. I have no other symptoms other than the pain. I was prescribed Naproxen 500 mg twice daily which helped for two weeks. Pain came back a week after stopping Naproxen, but more mild than before. Then went away for five days and returned. Now, Naproxen does not seem to help at all. Doctors have not been concerned enough to give me a scan, because I have no other symptoms and just the pain. Again, this has been going on for two months now and even on pain-free days while on naproxen I have still had brief one second flashes of pain at least a couple of times a day. I have no sickness or nausea or dizziness. I do not have a history of migraine.There is no pain behind my eye or tearing. I also have no anxiety or tension issues in my personal life to attribute to a headache. The pain is in my left temporal area. I feel some pressure, pinching pain and tightness. Sometimes, it is in the inner ear and sometimes I have pain on the top left of my head. Before I started the Naproxen, it was at its worst at bedtime when I laid down, but I slept pain free for a month while on the Naproxen. The pain is quite mild, but persistent. So, it is very annoying and always on my mind now that the Naproxen does not seem to work at all and I cannot rely on it for relief. Why would naproxen suddenly stop working? Should I be concerned that I have a sinister condition?"

"Hi doctor, My current medications are 60 mg Cymbalta for depression and 300 mg Seroquel for the sleep disorder. I am in my 40s and I have had a few episodes of depression during my lifetime. I was lucky enough to be able to attend a psychiatrist in a country I lived in for a long time. It was a great help. My question at the moment is about medication. When I was quite depressed I took Cymbalta and another antidepressant which I am fairly certain was Wellbutrin. I dropped the secondary antidepressant after a year or so as I began to feel better. I am just considering using it again as I am now in a state of emotional upheaval due to a family death. I have just got in touch with a GP for an appointment in the next two weeks. What I would like to know is, it safe to take Cymbalta, Seroquel, and go back to Wellbutrin? How would I work the dosage? Would I start with 150 mg of Wellbutrin and possibly go up to 300 mg? When should I take the antidepressants? Can I take them both at the same time, or do I need to space them out? I am not prone to seizures and I have never had one. I am a female."

"Hello doctor, I was wondering if anyone could tell me about my condition. I used to go to an eye doctor when I was little but I cannot remember when I last went. I was never pushed to go by my parents when I was younger, only when I needed a new pair of glasses. I was born with one eye small, the other normal. My vision is fine, I am very nearsighted but with glasses, I see quite well. My depth perception is normal too, I can see most things and when I tried to drive once, it went well. In my affected eye pupil is floating around. I cannot see much out of it, and it is not big enough. Other than that, no other health conditions. Could anyone tell me what this is? Is it something that progresses and will I go blind someday?"

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well."
"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing? I do not get excited during sex and unable to ejaculate. Only, rubbing the tip of the penis gives me excitement. Also, two weeks ago, I have undergone circumcision as my foreskin did not retract. Before circumcision too, I have the same problem. Please help."
"Hi doctor,  I have persistent heartburn related symptoms for the last four to five months. I visited a gastro and he prescribed me medicines for 14 days. My conditions got better but not fully cured, so I was given another 14 days of medicine (including a proton-pump inhibitor). Soon the lockdown kicked in and I went back to my home. I meanwhile took Ayurvedic medicines for a month here. While it has reduced the duration of heartburn episodes, the problem has not gone yet. For the last month, I have mild heartburn (pain in chest) for 20-60 minutes in a day (spread across three to four intervals). 14/30 days my throat felt different. 7/30 last days had acid refluxes. But heartburn occurs daily. I have tried varying my diet, but have not found any significant changes. Is this a cause of concern that despite having medicines for 42 days, I still have mild heartburns occurring daily? What should I do? How long will it take for a medicine to show the effect? Should I continue the course and if so, for how long? And if yes, does prolonged usage of medicine have side effects? Or if left untreated, do they have side effects? I took Somproz initially for four days, Lesuride-25, and Deltone for 14 days, and for the next 14 days I took Lesuride 25 and Nexpro 40."
"Hello doctor, I have scrotal pain for the past one year and my ultrasound is normal. Please help."
"Hello doctor, I am a man in my early twenties that started using hearing aids about a year ago. I am very happy with this, it has really changed my life. Just recently I started reading up a bit more and now I feel very confused and weird about it all. The thing is, I was told I had a mild mid-frequency hearing loss. When I actually look at my audiometry test it shows that as well, but my hearing is barely within the range of being considered a hearing loss. Reading around I found out that most people with such a mild loss can mostly hear fine and do not need hearing aids. When I read about what my hearing loss is supposed to be like, I do not relate. I relate way more to the explanations of what moderate hearing loss sounds and feel like. And hearing aids help me a lot. When I do not wear my hearing aids it sounds to me like listening to people talking through a door. I rely a lot on lip-reading if I cannot wear my hearing aids, phone conversations were almost impossible before I got them. I just cannot make my hearing loss make sense with my actual experience with hearing. So I have been wondering what causes me to feel like I hear so bad when my hearing is just slightly below the normal range? I should say that I have tinnitus as well, sometimes quite a lot, so that maybe factors into it too. Recently I began to wonder whether the reason I hear so much worse compared to other people with my level of hearing loss? Is that I have ADHD and PTSD which makes it so hard to focus? Do you think this is a possibility? Or could it simply be that I handle my hearing loss worse than others? I just do not understand why I experience hearing speech as so difficult and why I am so dependent on hearing aids when my hearing loss is technically very mild?"
"Hello doctor, I am a 32-year-old male. I have no previous conditions or problems, and I take no medications.

I have been on birth control to help manage and track them, but as of recently, I have been having more sporadic periods. For instance, from the beginning of January through the end of February, the pill I was on was no longer helping and I was on my period for two weeks at a time with five days gap in between each period. And I have been experiencing more intense cramps during my period that start in my lower abdomen and extend through to my butt. If I had to describe it, it feels like a stabbing pain from my belly button straight through my body to butt if that makes sense. I am 19 years old and I have never been to a gynecologist. Please help."

"Hello doctor, I got the influenza vaccination about a week ago and have a swollen and painful lump in my armpit."
"A couple of weeks before I got severe heartburn, I often felt really bloated and nauseous especially after meals but I kept ignoring it as the symptoms would go away. A month back, I had a faint heartburn throughout the day, and woke up in the middle of the night with severe heartburn all over my chest . Mid week it was so bad that it went in my throat and everything. I went to the hospital and was immediately prescribed ranitidine 150mg for 14days. As it came to week 2, I got only worse, with no sleep whatsoever, lump in my throat, extreme fatigue where my leg was involuntarily fluttering and my lip was voluntarily twitching. By third week I started omeprazole 40mg with the ranitidine and the heartburn intensity reduced but I experienced lots of other symptoms like bloatedness, stomach making noises all the time, nausea, breathlessness was the main one, heart palpitations which were never ending and this constant pressure on my nose and head. I’m now in week 5 and unfortunately the heartburn is still very much there, it comes and goes. The lump in My throat has improved from the second week but it still feels very heavy, I can almost press it and feel something clicking. Doc has said to double my dose of omeprazole so to take 80mg plus ranitidine. Will I get any relief at all from this constant heartburn and all the other symptoms? Am I in some sort of serious trouble? I’ve lost quite a bit of weight, I’m on bland food, elevated at night and all the lot but yet my quality of life is so heavily impacted as I can’t do anything throughout the day because of the constant palpitations, heartburn or pressure in my nose and head or the bloatedness and nausea. The heartburn gets worse after i eat. Please help! I’m only 28 and don’t understand why this happened to me as i was never obese or had any health conditions except hypothyroidism. Last thing to mention, my stools since having acid reflux issue has been a pale yellow and has only recently started to be brown again, what could this mean as well? Any help would be appreciated, as docs are just putting it down to anxiety and stress all the time."
"Hello doctor, My baby just turned 6 months. I gave him Nan Optipro One for his 1st to 6 months, now I gave him the follow up milk which is Nan Optipro Two.

"Hi. My grandmother is 80years of age. Over the past year, her hillucinations have increased with time, from what was occasionally to now daily. I've had her to the doc for blood tests, she's perfectly healthy in all bodily aspects. Treated for mild kidney infection on two occasions recently. Hillucinations seem to be in patterned images like floors, tiles, counter tops & clothing. Her most recent GP has not quite ruled it as Dementia as yet. Short term memory has faded. Aggression has also increased. Re-arranges the bedroom on a daily basis. Accusations of personal possessions being stolen by these so-called persons in her bedroom.   How can we treat this? Desperately needing some advice as to the next steps to take.  Thank you in advance."

"Hi! I am a 29 year old male with 171 cm height and 55kg weight and suffer from IBS. Every time I go to toilet, I have pain while defecating and after it, I have a burning sensation in the anus region for the whole day. Sometimes I also have abdominal pain but I think this is due to IBS. Before and after going to the toilet, my anal lining is normal but during defecation, something bulges out and I am not sure if these are hemoroids or this is mucosal rectal prolapse. After defecation I have burning sensation in my anus and mild pain in my left side. I also suffer from constipation (go to toilet 3 times per week) and almost always have to strain when going to toilet. When I am anxious, I suffer from diarrhea and my stool is mostly liquid. But if I am not anxious, I suffer from constipation.  I already excluded all wheat / grain as it was causing me gases and pain and my IBS improved but I still have occasional abdominal pain (especially after defecation). Can you please help me understand if I have hemoroids or mucosal rectal prolapse and what I need to do to cure them?"

"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing? I do not get excited during sex and unable to ejaculate. Only, rubbing the tip of the penis gives me excitement. Also, two weeks ago, I have undergone circumcision as my foreskin did not retract. Before circumcision too, I have the same problem. Please help."

"Results from an HSG procedure showed that I have a bicornuate uterus or a thick septum. Both Fallopian tubes are patent. But there is an abnormal position of the uterine body, possibly due to a cystic nodularity in the right adnexa, displacing the entire uterine body toward the left side of the pelvic cavity.   Currently trying to conceive and I'm pretty concerned about the complications with both fertility and pregnancy due to the potential above diagnosis.   Further clinical evaluation is recommended. What can be done to fix this and/or make the changes for a healthy full-term pregnancy?   Thanks!"
"Hello doctor, Last February, I have had an ear infection from cleaning my left ear too often with a q tip. I went to the hospital and was prescribed Aplosyn otic drops, Celebrex, and an antibiotic which starts with a letter L (I forgot it as I lost the prescription. I am sorry). I took it for a week and went back to the doctor to have me flushed. He told me my eardrum was not perforated. All went well until two nights ago. I gently cleaned my left ear with a q tip after shower before going to sleep. I woke up the following morning with mild pain in my ear (maybe because I was sided left all throughout my sleep and have put so much pressure on it). Today I used a mirror to have a look at it. It looks like it has pus again and the moderate pain now is up to my left neck. What should I do? Please help."

"Hello doctor, I am a 30-year-old healthy woman. I am diagnosed with anxiety disorder 10 years ago. For the past year, I have been experiencing crippling health anxiety. I have experienced a number of frightening symptoms, including brain zaps, weakness in legs, body twitching, dizziness, etc. Last year, I had a CT scan, and MRI of the head and neck. I consulted with a family doctor and neurologist, terrified of MS. All scans came back clear. My doctor said this was all a result of my anxiety and also said he thought I was suffering from GERD or acid reflux. I felt better for some time but for the past two weeks, I started experiencing very strange symptoms that I have never before felt in my life. I get on and off tinnitus in my right ear, seeing small bursts of light once or twice a day, and feeling of spice/burning in the back of my tongue while eating bland nonspicy food. I have called my optometrist who did a full workup less than a year ago. I have 20/20 vision and no eye conditions. I explained the small bursts of light and he was not too worried and simply told me to keep track and let him know if they are increasing. So far they are not. But these small bursts of light coupled with the tinnitus and also the tongue burning sensation has absolutely terrified me. I am terrified I have a tumor or brain cancer. This fear is crippling me and I can hardly think straight. Should I be concerned? I am on the verge of running to the ER every night and begging for a CT scan. Please help."

"Hello doctor, I am a 28-year-old male in good health. I have suffered bouts of depression for the past few years along with anxiety and OCD. I am on Zoloft every day and am doing well for the most part. I am staying active and keeping busy. The reason why I ask this is, that on my mother's side there are two stories of people with suspected schizophrenia. My maternal grandmother's mother was said to have been institutionalized for her life because of it, and my maternal aunt (mom's sister) is a paranoid schizophrenic, according to my grandma. Does this skip generations? Neither of my parents or siblings has this condition. What are the chances of becoming a schizophrenic? Do I have anything to worry about?"

"Hello doctor, I started the Depo shot before six months and I missed my second shot. I did not continue getting the shot, so I have been off birth control. It was my first Depo shot I have ever received and I am not sure how long it takes to be totally gone. But, I have been very sexually active with my boyfriend for the past few months. I have not started my period as I got the shot. Yesterday, I bled very lightly, but only for a couple of hours and then it stopped completely. I am wondering if this could be implantation bleeding? I have had a couple of bad headaches recently, but do not feel as crampy as I do when I am on a normal period. I was wondering that any chances to become pregnant or not. But I have not noticed any morning sickness or weird cravings. Please suggest me."
"Hello doctor, My partner, who is 36 years old, broke his ankle (fibula break) before 7.5 weeks. I had been for his appointment where he had an x-ray and found that the bone has not knitted together. He smokes approximately 10 cigarettes per day. I have found through online research, that smoking hinders bone healing and have advised him to stop, even if short term to assist with the healing of the broken bone. He had cast for three weeks and then was transferred to a walking boot with vague instructions on how to deal with it. He is being told that he should be walking more on the ankle which is broken. But, he is worried as he will cause more damage as it is not yet aligned. Also, should he be wearing his walking boot at all times? He wears while sleeping and he removes it while bathing daily. Please explain to him that how the bone will heal and whether he should be wearing his boot all the time."
